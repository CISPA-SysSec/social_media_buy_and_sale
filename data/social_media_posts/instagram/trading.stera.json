    "1": "USDJPY D1 \n\nLeading on from the analysis we shared last week, this has been a bit of a slow burner, we sold off a few times from that sell zone indicated around 151.600 ish, offering circa 1.75R before then coming back towards our sell zone. \n\nOnly this morning during the eastern sessions and EUR/LON open have we seen a more aggressive selloff. \n\nWhether we break and hold, we shall soon find out. \n\nOf course, as you can see, this selloff follows a pin of previous SL. We are still looking to get back in this position.\n\nAll being said, lots more opportunity expected from this setup. Let\u2019s see what unfolds throughout the week and next, as we are still hovering around our key point of interest (sell zone).",

What do you think is expected from XAUUSD this week?\n\nEyes peeled on this new range forming, nothing we are looking to execute imminently, would love to see some confirmation on the higher timeframe and to see price still within that 2080-2090 range before considering shorts. \n\nUS stock indices are on the agenda too, as we look to continue setting fresh highs, the volatility is immense right now. \n\nLooking forward to the week ahead, we were very unfortunate with a few of our trades last week. But that\u2019s just the way the cookie crumbles.\n\nMore payouts and withdrawals revived and submitted last week, looking to outperform the month of February in March.\n\nHave a blessed one! We will be looking to trade XAU a bit on our @swaymarkets and @mi.funder accounts this week!",
