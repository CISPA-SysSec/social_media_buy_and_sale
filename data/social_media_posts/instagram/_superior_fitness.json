A balance that will enable you to get stronger and progress in your training quickly.\n\n\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\n#deadlifts\u00a0#backday\u00a0#technique\u00a0#backworkout\u00a0#backworkouts\u00a0#musclebuilding\u00a0#pullday\u00a0#squats\u00a0#glutes\u00a0#quads\u00a0#hamstrings\u00a0#yoga\u00a0#fitness\u00a0#mobilitywod\u00a0#flexibility\u00a0#physicaltherapy\u00a0#yogi\u00a0#bodybuilding\u00a0#deadlift\u00a0#squat\u00a0#hypertrophy\u00a0#legday\u00a0#workout\u00a0#yogaformen\u00a0#physio\u00a0#irishfitfam\u00a0#mobility\u00a0#hipmobility\u00a0#yogafit\u00a0#iifym",

    "10": "How to keep making progress in the gym \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\u203c\ufe0f\n\nThis is called progressive overload.\nProgressive overload is a principle of strength training that states that in order to continue making progress, the demands placed on the body must be gradually increased over time. This can be achieved in a variety of ways, such as by increasing the weight lifted, the number of repetitions or sets, the volume of work, or the intensity of the workout.\n\nThe idea behind progressive overload is that the body adapts to the demands placed upon it. By gradually increasing the demands, the body is forced to adapt and become stronger, which ultimately leads to improved fitness and muscle growth.\n\nTo ensure proper progression it is important to track your progress, by writing down your exercises, reps, weight, etc. With that in mind, the goal is to achieve a slight increase on the volume or weight at each workout session.\n\nIt is important to note that progressive overload is not only about adding weight or reps. Different exercises, different tempos, different range of motion and different rest periods can be added to the routine to progress.\n\nIn summary, progressive overload is a principle of strength training that states that in order to continue making progress, the demands placed on the body must be gradually increased over time. This can be achieved by various means, such as increasing the weight lifted, the number of reps, the volume of work, or the intensity of the workout and it's important to track your progress and make small adjustments to make sure you are progressing in your workout. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to dm me \ud83d\udc4d\u203c\ufe0f\n\n#fitness\u00a0#gym\u00a0#workout\u00a0#fitnessmotivation\u00a0#fit\u00a0#motivation\u00a0#bodybuilding\u00a0#training\u00a0#health\u00a0#love\u00a0#lifestyle\u00a0#fitfam\u00a0#instagood\u00a0#healthylifestyle\u00a0#sport\u00a0#gymlife\u00a0#healthy\u00a0#gymmotivation\u00a0#personaltrainer\u00a0#muscle\u00a0#crossfit\u00a0#fitnessmodel\u00a0#instagram\u00a0#exercise\u00a0#fashion\u00a0#follow\u00a0#weightloss\u00a0#like\u00a0#model\u00a0#fitnessjourney",
