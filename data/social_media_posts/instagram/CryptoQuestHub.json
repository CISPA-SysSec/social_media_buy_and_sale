    "6": "Crypto enthusiasts warn against naira trade ban on exchanges\n\nNigerian crypto enthusiasts warn that halting naira trading on cryptocurrency exchanges may exacerbate issues for the volatile fiat currency \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec. Rume Ophi of SiBAN argues that blaming global crypto platforms for the naira\u2019s depreciation is impractical.

    "11": "US political change could expose crypto to $20T industry\n\nBitwise\u2019s Matt Hougan suggests that U.S. regulatory clarity could unlock the $20 trillion financial advisory industry for crypto \ud83d\udcb0.
