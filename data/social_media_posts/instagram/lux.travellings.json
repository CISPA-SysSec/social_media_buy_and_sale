Additionally, the breakfast served on our rooftop terrace was simply divine \u2615\ufe0f\ud83e\udd50\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t just the hotel that made our experience so memorable. Lucerne is a truly enchanting city, and we fell in love all over again with its charming streets, the iconic Chapel Bridge, and the picturesque waterfront \ud83e\udda2 \n\nVisiting during the Christmas season added an extra layer of magic, with the Christmas Market bringing festive cheer to the already beautiful surroundings \ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udffb We were delighted to witness the first snowflakes of the season while eating heisse Marroni - hot roasted chestnut \u2744\ufe0f\ud83c\udf30\n\nThe hotel\u2019s Christmas decorations were also absolutely enchanting, adding an extra layer of festive cheer to our stay. The lobby was adorned with beautiful wreaths, and there were several Christmas trees throughout the property, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere \ud83c\udf84With the touch of festive music it truly felt like a winter wonderland, and we couldn\u2019t help but be filled with joy and holiday spirit every time we walked through the hotel. \n\nWe couldn\u2019t resist taking advantage of the hotel\u2019s spa, which offered a tranquil and rejuvenating escape \ud83e\uddd6\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n\u2728 Follow @izabel.philippa for more wanderlust inspo, travel tips and beautiful hotels \u2728 \n\n\ud83d\udccd Lucerne, Switzerland \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udded\n\ud83d\udece\ufe0f @mo_luzern\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#IAMAFan #mopalace #mandarinoriental #luzern #inlovewithswitzerland #lucerne #vierwaldst\u00e4ttersee #mohotels #schweiz #beautifulhotels #switzerland_destinations",
