    "9": "\u201cI\u2019ll do it later\u2026\u201d\n\n-Is one of the worst mindsets you can have.\n\nI fall victim to this as well. Over the last few days I have been working out a little earlier than normal. I eat my pre workout meal then go to the gym first thing. I\u2019ve been telling myself, I\u2019ll go to the gym and do my morning routine later. Guess what\u2019s happened over the last few days?\n\nI haven\u2019t done my morning routine of affirmation, reading and goal setting.\n\nIt\u2019s so easy to put it off until a more convenient time. I get it, I really do. \n\nHowever, having that mindset will get you nowhere. More often than not you won\u2019t do the task later. \n\nNow relate that to fitness.\n\nHow many of you have told yourself \u201cI\u2019ll go to the gym later\u201d for the last year? Are you happy with the results you\u2019ve gotten from the work you haven\u2019t done? \n\nExactly. I\u2019m guessing not. So I challenge you to go to the gym today. Get home from work,  change and leave. Don\u2019t sit down. Don\u2019t say you\u2019ll go later. Bc you won\u2019t. \n\nDon\u2019t know what to do in the gym? \nDon\u2019t know what to eat to get results? \nNeed someone to hold you accountable? \n\nHi, my names Dalton.
