She acted like the queen of the house, barking orders.\n\nShe\u2019d leave dirty dishes everywhere and laundry piled up. I blamed everything on her illness.\n\nSuddenly, she decided to host a party in our home, inviting people over, planning a menu, and assigning me tasks. I felt angry but agreed to help, thinking it could cheer her up.\n\nBut later that evening, I overheard her talking with her husband:\n\n\"What the HELL are you doing? The party?! Be sick MORE naturally or they'll kick us out.\"\n\nI FUMED inside...she WASN'T SICK.

There were three people (one man and two women) who recently moved in above us who all worked in the restaurant industry. Almost every weeknight they'd come home at 2:00 a.m. and proceed to BLAST their TV, which was located above our bedroom.\n\nOne night I finally had enough and went upstairs to knock on their door. The man answers and I proceed to ask him why his TV is so loud. He then informs me that it's probably the SUBWOOFER. I ask him if he could turn it down and he responds with something along the lines of, 'Well, after a long shift we all like to wind down and watch a movie. Turning off the subwoofer would decrease the quality of the experience.'\n\nI asked if he was serious and he just stared at me blankly. So I went back downstairs and informed my then gf of what happened and we devised a plan. All she had to do was take my\" \u2b07\ufe0f",

I wasn't looking for anything serious, but we hit it off immediately. Our first year of marriage was like a honeymoon.\n\nThen I lost my job when my company went bankrupt, which was a huge blow. When I told Gregor, he was clearly annoyed.\n\n\u201cWhat, now I'm the breadwinner?\u201d he said, dissatisfied.\n\nShocked, I quickly took a job as a cleaner to help us stay afloat.\n\nFast forward to Gregor\u2019s 45th birthday. He threw a big party at a fancy restaurant. When his sister toasted to how lucky he was to have me, I felt touched.\n\nThen Gregor stood up and said, \"Oh, I know I'm lucky, but she's basically my dependent now. I'd have kicked her out if she wasn't so obedient. It's just a pity I invested all that money in her.\"\n\nThe room went silent, and I turned crimson with embarrassment. He was laughing...

Once, I rescued a guy from a burning building and ended up with a nasty burn on my face. My wife couldn't handle it and eventually left me. But the worst part? My daughter, whom I was raising alone, was so embarrassed by my appearance that she didn't want anyone to know I was her dad.\n\nOne day, she blurted out, \"I don't want my friends to see what a MONSTER you are! That's why mom left! I don't want to lose my friends too!\"\n\nShe was only 8 when I got burned, and I thought she'd come around. But as the years went by, she remained embarrassed and distant.\n\nI had pretty much given up hope and resigned myself to the situation when out of the blue, her classmates showed up at our door.\ud83d\udc47",
