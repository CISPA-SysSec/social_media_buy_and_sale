The doctor thought for a little, and\nafter some silence\nhe said to the lady: 'I think I have a better solution for\nyour problem. It's less dangerous for you too.' She smiled, thinking\nthat the doctor was going to\naccept her request. Then he continued: 'You see, in order for you not\nto\nhave to take care 2 babies at the same time, let's kill\nthe one in your arms. This way, you could rest some\nbefore the other one is born. If we're going to kill one\nof them, it doesn't matter which one it is. There would\nbe no risk for your body if you chose the one in your arms. The lady\nwas horrified and said: 'No doctor! How\nterrible! It's a crime to kill a child! 'I agree', the doctor replied. 'But\nyou seemed to be OK\nwith it, so I thought maybe that was the best solution.' The doctor\nsmiled, realizing that he had made his\npoint. He convinced the mom that there is no difference in\nkilling a child that's already been born and one that's\nstill in the womb.

    "13": "PLZ READ 4 ZE SAKE OF ALLAH\ncelebrating April Fool's Day is haram? Why?\nYes it is, because of the origins of April Fool's Day, OR because you\nwould be lying, OR because you would be imitating the Kuffar. OR\nall three.\nThis is one version:\nIt was around a thousand years ago that Spain was ruled by\nMuslims. And the Muslim power in Spain was so strong that it\ncouldn't be destroyed. The Christians of the west wished to wipe\nout Islam from all parts of the world and they did succeed to quite\nan extent. But when they tried to eliminate Islam in Spain and\nconquer it, they failed. They tried several times but never\nsucceeded.\nThe unbelievers then sent their spies in Spain to study the Muslims\nthere and find out what was the power they possessed and they\nfound that their power was TAQWA. The Muslims of Spain were not\njust Muslims but they were practicing Muslims. They not only read\nthe Quran but also acted upon it.\nWhen the Christians found the power of the Muslims they started\nthinking of strategies to break this power. So they started sending\nalcohol and cigarettes to Spain free of cost. This technique of the\nwest worked out and it started weakening the faith of the Muslims in\nparticular the young generation of Spain. The result was that the\nCatholics of the west wiped out Islam and conquered the entire\nSpain bringing an end to the EIGHT HUNDRED LONG YEARS' RULE\nOF THE MUSLIMS in Spain. The last fort of the Muslims to fall, was\nGrenada (Gharnatah), which was on the 1st of April.\nFrom that year onwards, every year they celebrate April fools day on\nthe 1st of April, celebrating the day, they made a fool of the\nMuslims. They did not make a fool of the Muslim army at\nGharnatah only, but of the whole Muslim Ummah. We, the Muslims,\nwere fooled by the unbelievers. They have a reason to celebrate\nApril fool day, to keep up the spirit.\nDear brothers and sisters, when we join in this celebration, we do so\nout of ignorance. If we had known about it, we would never have\ncelebrated our own downfall.\nSo now, that we are aware of it, and now let us promise that we\nshall never celebrate this day. We should learn our lesson from the\npeople of Spain, and shall try to become practicing Muslims, never\nto let anybody weaken our faith NOR FOOL ( OR MAKE A FOOL OF )\nUS ANY MORE.\n_ _ _\nAnd even if not because of it's history, lying is Haram. Joking is\nconsidered lying also if it isn't true (unfortunately probably all of us\nstill do this). Even if you were to feel content with just \"joking\", it is\na Kafir \"celebration\", so by celelbrating it, we are imitating the\nKuffar. We are supposed to separate ourselves and set examples\nwith our actions, not drop ourselves to the level of the Kuffar. Our\nobjective is to do Dawah by our actions, and this can't be done if we\nare blending in and adjusting our lifestyles with the Kuffar.",
