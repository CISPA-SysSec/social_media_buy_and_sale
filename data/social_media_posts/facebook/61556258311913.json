But then, in the afternoon, there was a knock at the door. A delivery man stood there with this massive, wrapped box that was so big it barely fit through the doorway.\n\nI was stunned. As I started unwrapping it, a small note fell out, \"From the wonderful woman who gifted you a husband.\" My heart sank \u2013 it was from my MIL.\n\nHere's the thing. My MIL has never liked me. She always thought I wasn't good enough for her son, constantly reminding me of my modest background. When our baby was born, she didn't even visit and said she didn't approve of me as the mother of her grandchild.\n\nSo, when I saw the gift was from her, I was in shock. Was she finally trying to make peace?\n\nI ripped off the wrapping paper, revealing a plain box underneath. But when I opened it, my heart dropped. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. My hands trembled, and Mark, standing beside me, went pale. He grabbed his phone and called his mom immediately. \"What have you done, Mom?! You intentionally \u2b07\ufe0f",

Almost every weeknight they'd come home at 2:00 a.m. and proceed to BLAST their TV, which was located above our bedroom.\n\nOne night I finally had enough and went upstairs to knock on their door. The man answers and I proceed to ask him why his TV is so loud. He then informs me that it's probably the SUBWOOFER. I ask him if he could turn it down and he responds with something along the lines of, 'Well, after a long shift we all like to wind down and watch a movie. Turning off the subwoofer would decrease the quality of the experience.'\n\nI asked if he was serious and he just stared at me blankly. So I went back downstairs and informed my then gf of what happened and we devised a plan. All she had to do was take my\" \u2b07\ufe0f",

I tried to be there for her, but she always kept me at arm's length.\n\nDavid died five years ago, and then it was just Emily and me. I hoped we'd grow closer, but no matter how many birthdays or milestones we celebrated, there was always this barrier. Emily was private and independent.\n\nLast week, just before my 55th birthday, Emily called, wanting to take me out for dinner. Usually, she just sent a card, so this felt different.\n\nShe picked me up in a sleek red convertible. I thought it was a rental until she handed me the keys and said, \"Happy birthday. This is for you.\" Her voice was flat, almost mechanical. My mind raced.\n\nDinner was awkward, and I couldn't shake the feeling she was trying to buy her way out of guilt.
