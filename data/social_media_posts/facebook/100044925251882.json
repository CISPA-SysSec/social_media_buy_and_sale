I know that I am very transparent in my pain, and I do so because the Lord has called me to do so- in hopes to show others the joy and hope we have in Jesus, despite the pains of this world. So many ask \u201cHow do you do it? How do you suffer and keep going? How do you parent special needs and medically complex children, while you\u2019re so sick?\u201d  Some days, I don\u2019t even know how I do it. Many days feel impossible in all honesty. But that\u2019s where assurance comes into play. God does it. Not me. And if He is the one getting me through it, then I know there\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t get through as long as I\u2019m walking with Him. \n\nAt the end of the day, the only thing that keeps me going is having a relationship with God. It\u2019s not about a building or a special prayer or specific words. It\u2019s about taking time to spend with God just like I do my family. It\u2019s a relationship and you talk, I talk to God just like I do here, and I listen to worship music and look for His signs and guidance. On the days I can\u2019t go on one more minute, I cry, but I know he\u2019s crying with me. I know God doesn\u2019t make me sick. I know that sin in this world makes me sick, and honestly, knowing without a doubt that God is real, because He must be for me to have survived this long, He has proven He is real, helps me trust Him to also believe that eternity and heaven are real, and when I want to scream or do, and I feel like it\u2019s ending here, I remember this pain will pass, like a long labor, and at the end of it I will see a face and smile. It will be the face of Jesus, and I know that I will never suffer again. That is where my hope lies. In Him. \n\n\u201cThe suffering of this present time is not worthy to be compared to the glory that awaits!\u201d Knowing that the pain will not only end, but end forever and be replaced with eternal love and peace with God....I\u2019d do it all over again. I wouldn\u2019t have changed a single thing in my life. Suffering has shown me how real and miraculous God is. It\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m sure of. He\u2019s real and He loves us, and this pain will end and we will be rewarded and we will understand why we had to feel what we feel. Faith. Lots of Faith. I have faith in you and I will be praying that The Holy Spirit touches you today  in a way that you can feel here on earth, to know how real and active our God is. He sure loves you and so do I. \ud83e\udd79\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f\ud83e\ude77",

I have one more day to reach my goal for my scheduled appointments, procedures, tests and possible surgery at Mayo Clinic. Jesus, thank you for bringing me through today and giving me peace to face tomorrow. Bless every person who have donated to make this possible, and to those whom have prayed and kept my arms raised as I can\u2019t hold my own. Bless these people. These friends. These warriors. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\ude77 These next few days will be hard.
