    "3": "Forty-year-old Christopher G. Robertson was kayaking in Georgian Bay in Collingwood, Ontario, when the kayak took on water and capsized. He held onto his overturned kayak and called for help. Jamey Ruth Klassen, 16, high school student from Guelph, Ontario, was on the beach and entered the water and swam about 600 feet to the kayak. By then, Robertson had submerged. Seeing him on the bottom of the lake, Jamey dived 12 feet and pulled him to the surface. Jamey positioned Robertson face up with his head on her shoulder. He was unconscious and not breathing. Grasping him around the chest with one arm, she used the other arm and her legs to swim toward shore with Robertson. Jamey was nearly exhausted and shouted for help. A man on a paddleboard responded, and he and Jamey placed Robertson on the board. The man took Robertson to shore, where he was removed from the water. Jamey swam to shore. Robertson was revived and taken to a hospital, where he was treated. He recovered.\nCredit to the respective owner\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#jenniferlopez\n#alexandradaddario #AngelinaJolie #MeganFox #margotrobbie\n#chrisevans #ChristianBale #AnneHathway #BrieLarson\n#ScarlettJohansson #elizabetholsen #JenniferLopez\n#JenniferAniston #JenniferLawrence #priyankachopra\n#KristenStewart #HaileeSteinfeld #emiliaclarke #galgadot\n#wonderwoman #DC #mcu #MeganFox #kyliejenner\n#kimkardashian #kendalljenner",
