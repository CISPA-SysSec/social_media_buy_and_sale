Will Tricia the daughter of the aristocrats be able to love them both, even when she learns about the duo? Guess, we'll have to read deeper now. Let's go!\n\nTHE BEGINNING\n\nHer smile,\nthat smile\nHer beauty that yonder shines,\nand her love which doth strengthens me;\nLike the wind which blows unceasingly across the White Eastern sea\nShall it forever be?\nOh,I wish\nIf only wishes do come true...\n\n\u2740\u2740\u2740\u2740\u2740\u2740\u2740\n\nI am Tricia. The only child of Mr and Mrs Parker, honorable owners of Gravantees Ville.\n\n...Like I actually care...\n\nMum and dad were really harsh on me on the course of growing up, right from when I was a kid, and even when I attained puberty, it got even worse, freaking me out the more. I was never allowed outside;not on their watch 'cause they were too scared of letting me out, or so I thought. So technically,I was never really allowed to explore the outside world like the rest of the people. It didn't matter anyway. I still had a way of going against their bullshit rules, without them actually knowing - Making me one hell of a badass!\n\nYears swiftly passed and I gained admission into this popular college, at the far side of Fitchburg; a town where James resided. James was my best friend - Such sweet lad he was.\n\nRight from kindergarten, he and I never parted ways, but since he had to leave for college, we were left with no choice. But there's always a bright side to everything like they say, 'cause hear ye, people! I'm going to be schooling alongside with him\n\nI can't exactly say I had a boyfriend. Didn't fancy guys much, but when it came to James Halton, things were literally different. And my, such sweet partners we were. Guess his fancy charms and sweetness made me love him even more. Although,he had such a huge influence on me, that I could see, but it didn't matter to me. Anyway, sit tight. 'Cause we're going on one amazing, fun ride I bet you're gonna love. \n\n...Ciao...",

I remember telling you,\" He spoke as I recalled.\n\n........\n  \"Hey, Peez. What's popping?\" A savagely handsome, whiskey brown eyes lad approached me. \n\n  \"Pass.\" I sighed, shutting my locker.\n\n  \"Oh, c'mon, Parker. There's no need for that.\"\n\n  \"Oh, there is.\" I shot back. \"Now if you'll excuse me, I'll-\" I stopped, taking a deep breath. \"What do you want?\" I asked. \"You do know James got eyes on all corners, and boy, he'd be so mad if he saw the two of us talking right now.\" \n\n  \"Peez, don't tell me you still worry about that loser?\"\n\n  Hearing him call James that got me off steam. \"You know, Matthews, why don't you just beat it, and quit poking at my man at every chance you got! Not like you're any better.\" I scowled, pushing him aside.\n\n  \"Hey, hey, hey.... chilax! I'm sorry, all right?\"\n\n  \"Oh, you better be, dude! Look, I'm late for class, so if there's anything you wanna say, you'd better spill.\" I said to him.\n\n  \"Since when do you care about class?\" He joked, and I threw an angry stare at him.\n\n  \"Oh, fine. I just wanted to ask you if you'd like to be my date to the...\"\n\n  \"Oh, please don't say prom.\" I cut in, raising a brow at him.\n\n  \"I'm serious.\" He laughed. \"You know Halton's gonna be out, and I thought maybe - Well, maybe we could....\" \n\n  \"Oh, you thought wrong! Ciao.\" I said, walking out on him.\n\n  \"I'll be going to Campbell next summer.\" His voice rang. \"Hope to see you there.\" \n\n  \"Whatevs!\"\n........\n\n...Ah, those were the days...\n\n  The sound of his voice came yanking me out of thoughts. \"Huh?\" \n\n  \"Oops! I forgot you weren't listening.\" He laughed, placing a finger on his lips, which were quite full and moist.\n\n  Jeez. Am I really noticing his lips? I asked myself as he went on talking.\n\n  \"Oh, you still haven't changed, I see.\" \n\n  \"You know I'm not the only one.\" He grinned. \"Where' you headed, though? Certainly not to class. And certainly not in those.\" He laughed, staring at me.\n\n  Ah, jeez!\n\n  I shrugged. \"Well, it's none of your business. Hope you enjoy your stay here. Happy talking.\" \n\n  \"N-no, wait. Tricia! Tricia!!\" He called, but I was already out of earshot.\n\n  Lots better!\n\nDEREK\n\n  Damn! She's always doing that, I thought with anxiety, feeling hurt. I sulked inside, forcing myself to walk,  as I succeeded; if only it would be,  when time comes knocking....\n\n  I got home early, and was so worn out from the short, yet tedious class we had, owning to the activities we did, coupled with the one I had previously. I hoped for Philip to come, but he was nowhere to be found and I couldn't help but miss his presence. I didn't know why, but a part of me did wish he came, and I couldn't help thinking something was up somewhere, keeping me in thoughts.\n\n  \"You okay there?\" Karen's voice came jerking me out. \"You've been staring at nothing for a couple minutes, now.\" She said to me.\n\n  Karen was my other roommate. She was a Ghanaian, a half and half actually, as her mum was an Australian, and her dad, a Ghanaian. She had such pretty long hair, which she carried in braids, making her look more like an African queen, no doubt. She was slender, beautiful; her body like that of an athlete. She was in the same department with Joan. All this I learnt in one day - So me!\n\n  \"Y-yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.\" I faked a smile, getting up. \"Just need to head out for a couple minutes. I'll be back.\" I announced, walking out the door.\n\n  I strolled the sidewalks, stroking my arms, my head raised up, as I felt the warmth of the evening sun on every part of my body. I hummed a certain tune my mum used to sing to me when I was little, as I walked slowly, inhaling the nice scent of summer's airy breeze. I felt lost in the sweet melody, as I began singing, not minding if anyone was watching.\n\n  Sunflowers in the meadow \n  Red roses in the garden\n  One special as the other:\nScent of nature embracing summertime\nBringing to us happy memories\n\n  Memories, I stressed, a smile dancing across my lips.\n\n  \"My! Such talent you've got.\" A voice came startling me.\n\n  \"Oh my goodness.\" I jumped, panting for breath. \n\n  I turned around, a gasp escaping my lips. \"You again?!\" I said, my eyeballs enlarged as though they were about popping out from their sockets any minute.\n\n  \"Oh, be quiet. I'm not here for you.\" He hushed, making to leave.\n\n  I thought for a moment, grabbing hold of his arm, \"Wait! Don't leave,\" \n\n  \"Oh, how I've wanted to hear you say that.\" He laughed, turning around.\n\n  I feigned anger, pinching him real hard on his sides, and he gave a sharp groan. \"Whew! Damn, woman!\" \n\n  \"Oh, don't damn me, man! You following me?\"I asked suspiciously.\n\n  \"Well, what do you think?\" He smirked, making towards me.\n\n  I groaned, taking a step backwards, as he followed. \"Oh, don't you dare....!\"\n\n  \"Or else what?\"\n\n  \"Or else -\" I gasped, almost stumbling.\n\n  \"I got you. I got you. There! There, there now. Steady as you can.\" He went on saying, the softness of his voice ringing in my ears. \n\n  It was calmly and very soothing. Not like I cared, really.\n\n  \"You okay?\"\n\n  \"Oh, quit touching me.\" \n\n  \"Me? You're the one who came falling. A simple \"thank you\" will suffice.\"\n\n  \"You wish. By the way, I'm sorry about this morn.\" I said suddenly.\n\n  Like, what the hell?!\n\n  \"Oh, it's nothing. Hold on, did you just...\"\n\n  \"Zip it, Matthews!\" I hushed, rolling my eyes at him and making to leave.\n\n  He held me back, moving in front of me. \"Hey, you can't go now. I still wanna talk to you.\"\n\n  \"Talk to the trees, then! I'm quite sure they've got lots of earplugs with them.\"\n\n  \"Seriously? Is that how much you hate me?\" He frowned.\n\n  \"I don't hate you! I just hate the fact that you're always there, sucking up every air I wish to breathe alone. You know what, just leave me be, please!\" \n\n  Hearing my voice sound that way,  made my heart feel so heavy. And my conscience pricked me instantly like I've been stung by gazillion of bees.\n\n   \"I...I shouldn't have said that,\" I shook my head.\n\n  \"No. No, it's fine.\" He smiled.\n\n  \"Derek -\"\n\n  \"Good night, Parker.\"\n\n  \"Derek...Derek, I'm sorry. Derek!\" I called, but his back was turned on me.\n\n  I watched as he disappeared, and I felt really worse - Worse than ever before....",

I was tied to the chair the whole time and kept wondering what Nicklaus and the maid was up to.\n\nAfter a long while, I heard the door open and the lights in the room went on and I tried to adjust my eyes in the darkness.\n\nI looked and discovered it was Shantel coming in.\n\nShe walked in stylishly without saying a word and stood in front of me.\n\n\u201cRoxanne\u201d she called and squatted in front of me.\n\u201cGerald\u2019s daughter\u201d.\n\nI bent my head and tried to ignore her.\nAlthough, her presence made me really uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cYour father was very powerful, you know?\u201d She continued.\n\n\u201cHe came from the lineage of royalty and was actually more powerful than the Lucifer at that time. But he was just too selfish and felt he was the rightful king of hell. So, he betrayed the King.\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m really curious. How did Lucifer get to love someone like you? You should be his greatest enemy \u2013 considering what your father did to him. Unless\u2026Nicklaus is actually wrong and Lucifer\u2019s not in love with you.

How I\u2019ve always despised this guy. This time around, I\u2019ll do everything possible to kill him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re trespassing, Lucifer; and you have the nerves to threaten me?\u201d I asked, but he didn\u2019t reply.\nI smiled and tried to hit him. I threw a light at him, but he missed it.\n\n\u201c5 seconds left\u201d he said and it angered me to the guts.\n\nI threw another light at him from my palm, but he still missed.\nWhat the f**k?\n\n\u201c3 more\u201d he stated.\nAll the while, his hands remained crossed behind his back.\n\nThis time around, I went to him instead and tried punching him in the face, but he held my fist and twisted it in a way that made me groan.\n\n\u201cTime up\u201d he said and pushed me backwards and I fell crashing to the floor.\n\nHe stretched his hand towards me and I felt my brains turning.\n\n\u201cNo!!\u201d I yelled angrily and in pains as I held my head, still on the floor.\n\n \nThen, he got to where I was and that was when he stopped.\n\n\u201cOh, Nicklaus\u2019 he called and squatted in front of me.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always been a weakling.

There were so many people, so many culture I craved so much to learn, most especially the Mayan.\n\n  \"Oh, why can't these assholes just quit it!\" I mumbled irritably.\n\n  I lifted my palms and with them, covered my ears, my eyes shut alongside as I tried so hard to separate myself from the unending noise that was always making me want to explode. \n\n  PHILIP'S P.O.V\n\n  I searched around for the pretty new girl I longed to see again. She sat all alone looking ravishing and calm. I walked towards her, not taking my gaze off.\n\n  \"Hey there,\" I greeted, a magnificent smile eluding her lips.\n\n  \"Oh, hi. How're you?\" She asked.\n\n  \"Heh. You got no idea.\" I joked, averting my eyes on the book that laid in front of her. \"What have we here?\" \n\n  \"Oh, just, you know, trying to cover up some things.\" She replied.\n\n  Her smile was perfect; Her oval face matching her perfectly pointed nose, alongside everything she had.\n\n  \"You got such an amazing smile.\" I remarked.\n\n  ...Shit! Shouldn't have said that...\n\n  \"T-thanks.\" She shyly said, and we began talking like we've known all along.\n\n  It felt really nice being around her and I couldn't help but marvel at such unparalleled grace God has created. \n\n  \"So tell me, what have you been up to?\" She asked, jerking me out of thought.\n\n  \"Well, nothing. I was just wondering if you could join me for lunch? You know, before the lecturer comes in.\"\n\n  \"Lunch?\" She paused for thought. \"Bet that won't hurt.\" She managed to say.\n\n  \"Alrighty. Lunch it is.\"\n\n  At late afternoon, I went to see James. I wore a smashing, red, hot, sleeveless mini gown that partly revealed my sides and a blue fancy slippers to match,  alongside a light make-up. Not like it was of any use, but I certainly didn't want to look unattractive in his sight.\n\n  \"Hi, baby.\" I said happily as the door swung open, revealing a hot figure with a towel wrapped around his waist, and the smell of aftershaves enveloping my nostrils.\n\n  He grinned, pulling me into his arms. \"You made it.\" He added, \"Never thought you would.\"\n\n  \"Well, why won't I?\" I laughed, feeling the coolness of James' body around my warm skin.\n\n  He shut the door behind, still not letting go as he began kissing me hungrily, without any pause. \"Damn! You're hot.\" He breathed, slowly sucking on the side of my neck.\n\n  I gave a soft giggle, \"You certainly couldn't wait, could you?\"\n\n  \"You got no idea,\" He laughed, slowly pulling the hands of my gown down as the enlarged part of my breast came in sight.\n\n  He made to suck slowly on them, one hand trying to set them free from the partly loose bra which held them gorgeously in place. I yearned for this and if there's anything I ever wished for, was for it not to stop - Never to end!\n\n  I was stark naked, left in a world of lust and love as we made love, our bodies entwined at the mercy of the sheet underneath us: The atmosphere reeking of nothing, but the driving sweat birthed from our constant love making and lubricious body rhythm.\n\n  I couldn't return back to Marionette, not after the long day I had. So I stayed back, and my, we sure did have such an amazing night to remember.\n\n  \"Leaving already?\" \n\n  \"Yeah,\" I nodded slightly, turning backwards. \"Will you, please?\" I said as he helped me with my zipper.\n\n  He made to kiss me as I put a finger across his lips. \"No, baby. Some other time.\" I added.\n\n  \"Awe, come on, just one more kiss,\" He persuaded.\n\n  \"Oh, fine. Have at it...\" \n\nI walked through the narrow path, my earplug inserted into my ears, trying to distract myself from some thought. The thought of having gone in bed with James after I told myself I wasn't - Again!\n\n  Ah, Parker, I muttered and stopped, taking out my earplug as I rummaged in my bag for a free gum.\n\n  I got it out, unwrapped it and took the whole in, allowing its sweetened chicle taste enclose my mouth. I began moving again, but this time, was held back by a strong grip - Who could that be? \ud83d\ude40\ud83d\ude40\ud83d\ude40\n\n\ufffc\nTBC...",

But she looked surprised.\n\nRyan. I had to get him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back, mum; I promise\u201d I told her as I laid her head properly on the floor and stood up.\n\nI ran back to where Ryan was and I was shocked at what I saw. He was surrounded by the evil creatures and was trying to fight them off with his powers.\n\nI looked into my both palms. I could feel it \u2013 the powers \u2013 that strange feeling; it was there.\n\nMy breath became still.\n\nThey were over whelming me.\nIt was just too much.\n\nSome of the creatures saw me and charged at me and I stretched out my both hands to them. I didn\u2019t even know how it worked. I just did it and a light came out from my palm and struck at the creatures, making the yelp and vanish.\n\nIt frightened me.\n\nI was scared.\n\nNoticing the light, Damon turned to look at me and surprise was large writ on his face.\n\nHe was lost staring at me and didn\u2019t know he was being targeted by some of the creatures.\n\nI saw it and stretched my hand towards them and they all growled and vanished.\n\n \nThe rest of the creatures looked at themselves in surprise.\n\nThen, Damon came towards me and held my hands. My heart was racing so fast.\n\nHe stared into my eyes with our hands joined and suddenly, I felt a different feeling around me.\n\n \nA heavy force started hitting at me \u2013 like it wanted to explode me.\n\nI looked at our hands and noticed a white light coming from it.\nWhat was he doing?\n\nImmediately, the rest of the creatures started shrieking.\n\nA fierce wind started howling in the dark, blowing everything around.\nI could hardly see properly.\n\nThe demons were all growling and then I noticed something;\n\nDamon was merging our powers so he could kill them.\n\nThe strong wind increased and so did the cries of the creatures.\n\n \nIt persisted for a long time and finally, it all stopped.\n\nThe wind, the darkness, the cries of the creatures.\nThey all stopped.\nEverything went back to normal.\n\n \nI looked around and confirmed it.\nThe place had really become so calm and quiet.\nThere was no trace of the creatures.\n\nI looked at Damon and he was staring back at me, breathing Heavily.\n\nI felt so weak.\n\nAnd immediately, I passed out.\n\n*\n\ud83d\udd56\ud83d\udd56\ud83d\udd56\ud83d\udd56\ud83d\udd56\n\nI opened my eyes blearily and the first gaze i caught was the ceiling.\n\nI groaned and sat up on the bed I was and looked around the room. It was Damon\u2019s room.\n\n \nWhere am I?\n\nI racked my head and tried recalling what had happened. The memories came flashing in.\n\nOh, my!\nMum!\n\nI was about leaving the bed when the door opened with Damon coming in.\n\nI sprang on my feet immediately.\n\n\u201cRoxanne\u201d he called, sounding surprised.\n\n\u201cMy mum! Where\u2019s she? I need to find her.\u201d I said restlessly and tried rushing out of the room but he stopped me.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t need to worry about her\u201d he said as he held me by the wrist.\n\n\u201cShe\u2026She was shot\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. She\u2019s being taken Care of\u201d he cut me off and I sighed, still feeling restless.\n\nOh goodness, please. I really hope she\u2019s fine.\n\nHe brushed his fingers into my hair and made me sit on the bed.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d He asked as he sat next to me.\nI touched my tummy.\n\nOh, my baby. I hope its fine.\n\n\u201cI\u2026I think I\u2019m fine\u201d I replied, batting my lashes.\n\nThat strange feeling \u2013 the powers \u2013 I could feel them.\n\nWere my powers really back?\n\nWasn\u2019t this what\u2026he\u2019s been waiting for?\n\n \nI looked at him and he sighed and stared away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you almost got hurt yesterday\u201d he started palely, staring into space.\n\n\u201cAll these are happening because I\u2019m yet to return to my kingdom. They will keep coming after me.\n\n\u201cI guess I was scared to leave\u2026leave you behind. But now, I don\u2019t think I have much of an option. I need to go back\u201d.\n\nI gasped and looked at him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026You\u2019re leaving?\u201d I asked, bemused and he nodded.\n\nThen, he held my cheeks and kissed me.\n\n\u201cI love you Roxanne\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t want to be away from you\u2026and my baby. But I have a kingdom to rule. Will you come with me?\u201d He asked and my eyes dimmed.\n\nWhat?\n\nI stared blankly at him, gibsmacked.\n\nHe wants me to go to hell with him?\n\n\u201cYou\u2026want me to come with you?\u201d I asked and he nodded.\n\n\u201cBut\u2026there are enemies there right? There are people who are trying to kill you\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThey only wanted me back. But, I\u2019m definitely gonna handle them when I return.\u201d\n\nI exhaled and stared at the floor.\n\nGoing to hell\u2026\nI never thought of it.\n\nBut\u2026I heard it was a terrible place.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong\u201d he said with a scoff.\n\n\u201cHell isn\u2019t as terrible as you all think\u201d.\n\nHe paused and turned to look at me, holding my hand.\n\n\u201cCome with me\u201d he said.\n\u201cJust for a short time. Let me show you a glimpse of hell. And when I\u2019m done, you decide if you wanna stay or return here to earth.\n\n\u201cWhatever you decide on, I\u2019ll be okay with it\u201d.\n\n \nI furrowed my brows in surprise and stared into his face.\n\nReally?\n\n\u201cDo you wanna give it a try?\u201d He asked with his palm stretched out.\n\nI looked at the open palm and cogitated.\n\nThen I heaved and placed mine on his.\n\n\u201cYes\u201d I replied and he almost smiled.\n\nHe stared Directly into my eyes and immediately, his eyes turned pure red and within the twinkle of an eye, I couldn\u2019t feel myself anymore.\n\nTBC.\nHm.

A strange place with a different atmosphere.\n\nLuckily, Damon was beside me, still holding my hand and that was the only thing that stopped me from panicking.\n\nHe started walking with me and we approached a tall huge building with a big black door.\nOh!\nThey were some armed guards by the door and the moment they spotted us, shock crept into their faces.\n\nI looked at each other in surprise and looked back at us.\n\n\u201cMy Lord\u201d they finally called and went on their knees immediately, keeping their heads bowed.\n\nDamon maintained a straight face as we walked pass them and surprisingly, the big door in front of us opened on it\u2019s own.\n\nWow!\n\nWe entered the gigantic room and my jaws dropped.\n\nIt was a throne room.\n\nYes, obviously.\n\nThere were some people in it who seemed to be having some sort of discussion and immediately they saw us, they all gasped in fright.\n\nAuthor\u2019s Pov:\nThe members of the council were all in a meeting when the door suddenly opened with Damon coming in with a lady.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The first elder exclaimed unconsciously.\n\n \nLucifer was back in hell?\n\nThey were aware he had been able to defeat the black Angels that were sent after him. But they never expected he\u2019d return at that moment.\n\nKaylan was overwhelmed.\n\n \nShe left where she stood and walked to where he was.\n\n\u201cLu\u2026Lucifer?\u201d She called with a little quiver in her voice.\nShe had been so scared he wouldn\u2019t be able to survive the black angels.\n\nFor the first time, she hugged him.\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t something she was supposed to do, but she had to. She felt so relieved seeing him there. She had never been in support of the elders trying to kill him.\n\nRoxanne stared at the floor and they disentangled from the hug.\n\nThen Damon left her and walked closer to the elders.\nHe left Roxanne behind as well.\n\n\u201cMy\u2026My Lord\u201d the elders greeted immediately with their heads bowed.\n\nDamon stood in front of them and crossed his hands behind his back.\n\n \n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be sitting when talking to me\u201d he said and clicked his fingers and it forced them to their knees immediately.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re surprised to see me, huh?\u201d He asked.\n\u201cYou thought I was dead\u201d.\n\n \nThen, the first elder stood up.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t blame us, Lucifer. What did you expect? You left the kingdom hanging for years\u201d she faciled.\n\n\u201cAnd that was enough reason to want to kill me and the mother of my unborn baby?\u201d He asked and all eyes darted to Roxanne who felt her feet wobble at the spot.\n\n\u201cSince you were meant to be dead, we didn\u2019t want any offspring of yours alive\u201d the first elder replied.\n\nThe rest of the people in the room were surprised at how boldy she could speak to him.\n\nDespite the fact they were all older than him, they dare not speak to him in that manner.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve grown so much wings huh?\u201d He asked.\n\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t need your tongue anymore\u201d.\n\n \nAnd immediately, she lost her tongue.\nIt just left her mouth and she couldn\u2019t speak anymore.\n\n\u201cMNM\u201d was all she could mumble when she tried to speak.\n\n\u201cHave a nice time in Oblivion\u201d he added and stretched his hand towards her and a light struck her from his palm.\n\nShe cried out and got lost immediately \u2013 vanished like she\u2019s never been there before.\n\nThe rest of the elders were drenched in fear and conniption as they kept their heads bowed.\n\n\u201cPlease Lucifer, we\u2019re sorry. We were only acting on her orders\u201d the third elder said.\n\nDamon took in a deep breath and kept his hands crossed behind his back again.\n\n\u201cWhat do you Call a set of people that tries to kill me when I\u2019m away?\u201d He asked but no reply came from them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not worthy to be called my subjects. Leave\u201d he said and without a second thought, they sprang on their feet and ran out of the room.\nAll they needed was their life.\n\nNow, the throne room was empty, leaving just Damon, Kaylan and Roxanne.\n\nWell, it\u2019d be very easy having them all replaced.\n\n\u201cHey\u201d Kaylan called as she stood to face Roxanne.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Gerald\u2019s daughter right?\u201d She asked and Roxanne nodded with a light smile.\nShe kind of felt nervous.\n\nThen Kaylan hugged her.\n\nOops.\n\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d be dead the moment Lucifer sets his eyes on you. Funny to know you\u2019re actually pregnant for him\u201d she said and Roxanne just chuckled.\n\nYeah, funny indeed.\n\n\u201cNice to meet you anyway\u201d she added.\n\n \n\u201cThanks\u201d Roxanne replied and looked at Damon.\nHe was staring at both of them.\n\n\u201cKaylan\u201d he called when they were done.\n\n\u201cMy Lord\u201d she replied immediately with a bow.\n\n\u201cI want you to call for a meeting with all the members of the cabinet. I want everyone present and I want that done as soon as possible. I\u2019ll be back\u201d he said and took Roxanne\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cCome on\u201d he stated and they left the throne room together.\n\nRoxanne was stunned at the appearance of *hell*\nShe had expected to see flames of fire everywhere, but it turned out to be something different.\n\nThere were houses there \u2013 just that they looked different from the ones on earth. Even the atmosphere was different.\nIooked foggy.\n\nSo many people were around, busy with activities and it amazed Roxanne that they were behaving just like humans.\n\nAll the people bowed in obeisance as Damon walked pass them.\nThat was actually the first time the King of hell was taking such a walk and they couldn\u2019t help but be nonplussed.\n\nA little kid ran up to Roxanne with a tiny flower.\nThe mother of the kid was scared to the teeth and tried calling her back, but the kid ignored.\n\n\u201cThis is for you, pretty miss\u201d she said with a smile as she held out the flower to Roxanne.\n\nRoxanne looked at Damoj and back at the kid.\n\n\u201cThanks\u201d she replied and took the flower from the kid who went scuttling Back to her mother.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She asked as she showed the flower to Damon.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when people like you. You can open with your powers\u201d he said and she furrowed her brows.\n\n\u201cHuh? How?\u201d She inquired.\n\n\u201cJust use your heart. Imagine it opening in your heart and it will be done in reality\u201d he replied and she chuckled and looked at the flower.\nIt sounded interesting to her.\n\nShe stared at it and just like he said, pictured it opening in her heart. And it did.\n\nShe gasped and giggled. It was magic. She did it?\nHow?\n\nShe giggled and looked at Damon with happiness.\nHe just smiled and took the flower from her, fixing it into her hair.\n\nWait;\nHe smiled!\n\nThat was the like the first time he ever smiled.\n\n \nRoxanne was gobsmacked as she stared into his face. But she couldn\u2019t ask him about it as he quickened his steps, probably trying to avoid the question.\n\nThey kept walking and finally got to a tall dazzling house.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this place?\u201d Roxanne thought as Damon took her into the house.\n\nRight there at entrance, they met some kids playing.\n\n\u201cHah!\u201d The children gasped the moment they saw them.\n\n\u201cIts Lucifer!\u201d They Exclaimed and ran to embrace him.\n\nRoxanne was surprised. So, people got to embrace him? She thought they were all scared of him.\n\nHe received their hug and dropped to a crouch in front of them.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d He asked in that unruffled voice of his as he brushed his hands on their heads.\nThey were four of them.\n\n\u201cMother! Lucifer\u2019s back\u201d one of them said while running into the house.\n\nWho could there be to him?\n\nImmediately, two women rushed out of the house and were started at the sight they beheld.\nThey placed their hands on their chest and stared in bewilderment.\n\nDamon stood up and took Roxanne\u2019s hand, going closer to meet them.\n\n\u201cHi aunt\u201d he said breezily as he stood in front of them.\n\n\u201cLu\u2026Lucifer?\u201d His aunt called, shock resounding in her voice.\n\nOh! So, she was his aunt? Roxanne thought.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201d The second woman asked and he gave a slight nod.\n\nHis aunt sighed and embraced him, clutching him tight.\n\nShe\u2019d missed him. She never thought she could see him again \u2013 the only son of her late sister.\n\n\u201cGood day ma\u2019am\u201d Roxanne had to greet when they disentangled from the hug.\n\nHis aunt sniffed and looked at her.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s she?\u201d She asked and Damon sighed.\n*\n*\n\u201cSo, Gerald\u2019s daughter wasn\u2019t dead after all?\u201d Damon\u2019s aunt asked as they all sat and ate together in the dining.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s good to have you back, Roxanne.\u201d The second woman said. \u201cAlthough, your father did a lot of despicable things, but with the story so far, its obvious you\u2019re different from him\u201d.\n\n\u201cThanks\u201d Roxanne simply said with a smile.\nIt still pained her to be reminded of her father.\n\n\u201cWhat is earth like, aunt Roxanne?\u201d One of the children asked and she smiled and looked at Damon.\n\n \n\u201cUh\u2026it\u2019s beautiful and just a slight difference with this place\u201d she replied.\n\n\u201cReally? So, you mean it\u2019s fun staying there?\u201d Another asked.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026maybe\u201d\n\nThe children looked at each other and stood up.\n\n\u201cCome with us, aunt. We have a surprise for you\u201d they said and took her hand, trying to make her stand.\n\n\u201cHey! What are you doing? Let her be\u201d their mother tried to stop them but they giggled and succeeded in lifting her up.\n\nDamon just smiled and looked down at his food as they took her out of the house.\n*\n*\nThey spent quite sometime over there and finally, Damon decided to leave.\n\nThe children who had been playing with Roxanne in the garden grumbled and begged her to return soon.\n\nShe hugged them tight before leaving.\nSo, this was what hell was like?\n\n\u201cI have one more place to take you\u201d Damon said and held her both hands.\n\nIt was just like a flash and they found themselves in an entirely different place.\n\nRoxanne looked around and noticed this place looked strangely different from the previous place they\u2019ve been. It looked\u2026ugly.\n\nDamon held her hand and walked further into it.\n\n\u201cYour friend Naomi\u201d he suddenly said as they walked along.\nRoxanne snapped her head to look at him immediately.\n\nNaomi \u00f1\n\n\u201cShe was threatened by Nicklaus to quit coming to school\u201d he said without looking at her and she gasped.\n\nWhat?\nNo wonder she strangely stopped coming to school. So, it was Nicklaus all along?\nHe probably did it to get close to her.\n\nBut how did Damon get to know about it?\n\nSuddenly, they got to a place which felt very hot. It was so hot that they had to stop walking.\n\nWhat was that place? Roxanne thought.\n\n\u201cWe Can\u2019t go any further\u201d Damon said.\n\n\u201cBeyond here is the flames of fire; the horrible place of anguish and torment\u201d.\n\nRoxanne looked at him confused.\nWhat was he talking about?\nFlames of fire?\n\n\u201cIts a place created by Zeus to punish his followers who fail to keep his commandments\u201d he further said.\n\n\u201cZeus?\u201d Roxanne repeated.\n\n\u201cYes. He\u2019s the immortal the humans refer to as God. He lives above \u2013 far up in the paradise \u2013 a place called Heaven\u201d he enthused and Roxanne batted her lashes with a nod.\n\nOh! So, that was how it was? She\u2019s never heard of it before.\n\nDamon held her hands and within the twinkle of an eye, they were no longer there.\n\nThey appeared in the middle of a dazzling garden, filled with sparkling flowers. It was so beautiful \u2013 like something Roxanne\u2019s never seen before.\n\n\u201cSo, Roxanne\u201d Damon Called and stood to face her.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\nShe bent her head and bit her lips.\n\nThe choices niggled at her.\n\nWas she to stay or return to earth?\n\nBut if Damon leaves earth, what about his wealth and properties?\n\n\u201cI can leave them to your mum\u201d he said, reading her thoughts.\n\nShe sighed and looked at him. But she was Going to miss earth.\n\n\u201cYou can always visit at anytime\u201d he said, reading her thoughts again.\n\n\u201cCan you stop reading my mind?\u201d She asked with an eye roll and he laughed.\n\nHe laughed!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t.

What was going to happen?\nHold on;\nCould it be the reason Shantel had acted strangely when she touched my tummy the other night?\nOh, my! Could it be possible she knows about the baby already?\nI was still thinking when I felt Damon hold my cheek.\nHe cupped my cheeks with both hands and lifted my face to look at his.\nMy lids fluttered as I stared into his eyes. Why\u2019s he holding me this way?\nHe drew his face close and kissed me.\nOh, goodness!\nThis is happening again.\nHe kissed me \u2013 again \u2013 for the second time but I couldn\u2019t reciprocate because I had no idea how to kiss.\nHis hands left my cheeks and went to the back of my waist, brushing them upwards.\nI closed my eyes and couldn\u2019t help but enjoy the kiss. Perhaps, there was nothing I could do.\nSurprisingly, within the twinkle of an eye, we were on the bed.\nLike, he just super sped to it.\nHow does he do it?\nHe unlocked from the kiss as he laid on top of me. He hid his face in my neck as he sent his hand under my dress.\nHis cold hand moving on my bare skin made me shiver and I shut my eyes and tried not to make a sound.\nBut, if he does this, wouldn\u2019t it affect the baby?\nI felt him touch my p**t and my eyes beamed.\nI thought he was going to pull it out, but he brought out his hand and came to my zipper instead.\nGoodness.\nHe pulled the zipper down and pulled the gown off my body, and next, he went for my p**t.\nFinally, I was lying stark n**ed in front of him.\nHe came in between my legs and planted a soft kiss on my tummy.\nHe kept kissing downwards until he got to my public bone and I gasped and flung my eyes open immediately.\nHe noticed the look in my eyes and released a light smirk.\nThen, he left there and came to my lips, giving me a gentle smooch.\nI was lost in the kiss and didn\u2019t realise when he started fingering me. I gasped immediately but couldn\u2019t yelp as a result of the kiss. He made sure I didn\u2019t unlock from it\nAfter a while, he stopped the kiss and fingering and went ahead to unhook his belt.\nI tried not to look as he took off his trouser and came in between my legs again.\n\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d He spoke softly into my ears and my heart skipped.\nI looked into his face and he was staring into my eyes.\nWas he really giving me an option?\nI gulped hard as my throat became sore.\nWhat did I really want? Was he to stop?\nDid I really want him to?\nHe sighed and kissed my ear lobe, giving it a little bite.\nThen, he tried leaving me, but surprisingly, I held him back.\nYes, I did. And I seriously don\u2019t know how I was able to do that.\nI didn\u2019t want him to go.\nI didn\u2019t want him to\u2026stop.\nHe stared at me as I held his arm.\nThen, he returned to his position and this time around, he s**ked from my b**bs.\nHe s**ked so roughly from them like an infant and I found myself holding his hair.\nWhat is wrong with me?\nI thought I never liked this?\nNext, he inserted his hard c**k into me and I couldn\u2019t stop myself from screaming.\n*****************\nI opened my eyes and found myself lying comfortably on the bed.\nI looked around and discovered I was in Damon\u2019s room.\nOh, my! I slept in his room after the\u2026\nGosh, Roxanne.\nBut\u2026normally, he\u2019d have taken me to my room when I slept off. How come he left me here?\nAnd where was he? Did he sleep here as well? Beside me?\nI sat up and sighed. I was n**ed and was covered with the duvet which I held to my chest.\nI recalled last night\u2019s incidence and it made me bashful, even if I was the only one in the room.\nWhat happened to me last night? Why couldn\u2019t I resist s3x with Damon? I mean, he had given me an option. Why couldn\u2019t I resist him?\nGeez! It seems my feelings for him were becoming something else.\nBut what if it gets me into trouble? I mean, I don\u2019t even know how he feels about me.\nAlthough he kissed me, but\u2026a kiss doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he loves me.\nOh, mercies! I wish I could get some answers to kill my curiosity \u2013 even if it were just a little bit.\nI covered my face in my palm and just then, the door to the bathroom opened with Damon coming out of it.\nWhat?\nOh! He was in the bathroom.\nOh, Roxanne!\nFire works.\nI couldn\u2019t face him.\nHe paused by the door for a second and proceeded to meet me at the bed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake\u201d he said calmly as he sat on the edge of the bed.\nI could feel my stomach rumbling.\n\u201cUm\u2026good morning\u201d I greeted nervously, looking down at the bed.\nAdnairax\nHe stood up without saying a word and surprisingly, came to carry me on the bed.\nI was shocked, but he did.\nHe carried me in his arms like a baby, making the duvet fall freely from my body.\nWhat\u2019s he doing?\nI thought of asking him but couldn\u2019t and he carried me into the bathroom.\nHuh?\nHe took me in and laid me in the bathtub which had already been filled with warm soapy water.\nHold on, did Damon prepare bath water for me?\nI laid In the bath tub, surprised and was happy the soapy water was able to cover my n**ed body from him.\nHe sighed and sat on the edge of the tub.\n\u201cIs it warm enough?\u201d He asked, giving a soft look into my eyes.\nAll I could do was nod. I was speechless.\nHe brought his hand to my face and used his fingers to brush the front part of my hair.\n\u201cHurry up with the bath. We\u2019ll be going out soon. I\u2019ve got a surprise for you\u201d he said tenderly and left.\nTo be continued\u2026",

I was shocked beyond words.\n\nBut what if this was true? And I was really pregnant? For Damon?\n\nI could remember\u2026\nMiss Margaret had said something about conception. And since Damon has been having s3x with me, isn\u2019t it possible for me to get pregnant?\n\nBut\u2026\n\nNo;\n\nThis isn\u2019t possible.\n\n\u201cRoxanne\u201d I heard Sally call from my outside and I shrugged out of my thoughts.

What if he tries to kill the baby?\n\nBut, do I even want this baby? How can I be a mother at this age?\n\nI Don\u2019t know anything about it. And Damon of all people! How can I have a child for him? I\u2019m the daughter of his greatest enemy. He wants to kill me.\nHow can I possibly have a child for him?\n\nI looked at him and noticed he was staring at me.

Take it easy.\" A calm voice came halting me as I quickly turned around, my eyes meeting with his.\n\n  Such charming gray eyes, I thought, blinking simultaneously.\n\n  He gave a welcoming smile, as my heart skipped a bit. \"I'm Philip.\" He said to me.\n\n  I gulped, wanting to say something, but no words came out.\n\n  \"Uh...\"\n\n  \"Oh, sorry. I...I'm Tricia,\" I stammered.\n\n  \"What a lovely name you got, Trish.\"\n\n  \"Oh, thank you.\" I blushed, forgetting all about class.\n\n  \"My pleasure. Come along, now. Class' this way.\" He gestured, as I followed.\n\n  Walking side by side with him made me nervous and I couldn't fathom out why. Maybe he's not human. Or maybe....Just maybe he's -\n\n  \"We're here!\" He announced, a smirk dancing across his perfectly, curved shaped lips. \"Welcome to LSAT hall. Come on in.\"\n\nThe two of us walked right in, taking our seats at the middle row, neither of us uttering a word, as a white bearded man walked in.\n\n  \"That's Professor Wane,\" The gray eyes lad whispered to me.\n\n  Feeling the warmth of his breath on my left ear, and hearing the softness in his voice made me wish he wouldn't stop.\n\n  \"He'll be taking us English Language, since Professor Shane isn't back yet.\" He added, much audible this time.\n\n  \"Oh.\" I said.\n\nI went about wondering how this one guy could make me act really nice - Nicer than ever before.\n\n  We sat in silence, eyes focused on the screen, except for the fact my mind remained unrest, with the frequent glances I kept throwing at my new friend. He seemed to notice, as our eyes met, and a soft chuckle escaped his lips.\n\n  My eyes glistened, and I felt a bit shy, thinking of the next move to take. \"So...where are you from?\" I asked, drawing invisible circles on my jean.\n\n  \"Britten hills,\" He smiled. \"Ever been there?\"\n\n  \"Nah.\" I gave a less sounding laugh.\n\n  He paused for a moment, his lips slanted at an angle. \"You don't say.\"\n\n...Great! I'm sure he thinks I'm Psyche...\n\n  \"Well, care to tell me yours?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah. I come from Henson.\"\n\n  \"Henson, huh?\"\n\n  \"Mm-hmm. Been there?\"\n\n  \"Been there?! Girl, are you kidding me?\" He laughed, his words, half a question. \"I spent half my childhood there.\" He added.\n\n\"No way!\" I exclaimed lowly.\n\n  \"I know right? You know my mum and dad used to go to this rich resort...\"\n\n  \"Gravantees?\" I cut in, and his eyes stood wide open.\n\n\"Yes! That's it!\"  \n\n\"Small world.\" I said ecstatically.\n\n  The smile he wore slowly disappeared. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n  \"N...\"\n\n  \"All right, guys. Let's call it a day.\" Professor's Wane's voice echoed in the hall.\n\n  Wait. That's it? I questioned myself as I watched students exit the class.\n\n  \"Be right back.\" Philip said to me as he hurried off in the opposite direction.\n\n  A red-hair black girl, dressed in a mini skirt and a matching slender top gestured to him, and I felt an ounce of jealousy gather up inside of me. \n\n  \"Oh,\" A soft moan escaped my lips and I instantly buried my head in my palms.\n\n  \"Hey there,\" Came a soft tap on my shoulder. \"Welcome aboard.\" She said, coming in front of me. \"I see Duchy's showing around already. The name's Chels. Chelsea Valentine.\" The brown hair girl said to me.\n\nShe had a black leather jacket atop a stylish pink gown that partly covered her smooth, slender legs.\n\n  \"Mm? You mean....?\"\n\n  \"Philip-\" She smirked. \"Saw you two come in.\" \n\n...Great! Maybe she's girlfriend number two...\n\n  \"That's Daphne, though. Daphne Martinez.\" The brown hair girl continued.\n\n  \"Daphne?\"\n\n  \"Mmm-hmm. I caught you staring at them.\" She giggled, moistening her lips.\n\n  \"Heh. I certainly wasn't staring.\" I shrugged, my conscience pricking me.\n\n  \"Oh, I won't tell.\" She winked. \"Phil's a great guy. We both attended the same high school.\"\n\n  Well, that explains a lot, I thought.\n\n  I faked a smile, getting up. \"Well, Chels. It's being nice talking to you.\"\n\n  \"Whew! I'm back. I'm sorry I took so long, Trish.\" Philip broke in. \"Oh, hey, C. You doing well?\"\n\n  \"You know it!\" Chelsea laughed as I averted my eyes swiftly. \n\n  \"So Trish, you ready to go?\" Phillip's question came.\n\n  \"Yes,\" I replied laconically.\n\n  \"Goody. You coming, Chels?\"\n\n  \"Ergh, I still got some things to do.\" She smiled, throwing a quick look at me and back at Phil. Guess, I'll see you two later.\" She said to us as we bid her goodbye.\n\n  The gray eyes lad and I walked side by side, under the warm airy breeze, the sun lighting our path as we walked on the less busy road, lined up with flowers and coconut trees, which made it such an amazing sight to behold. We chatted, and then I remembered we haven't really talked about the one thing I was wanting him to hear him say.\n\n  \"So Phil, what happened back there in class?\"\n\n  Did I just call him that?\n\n  \"Sorry?\" He stopped, confused. \"Oh, you mean with the girl I was talking with?\"\n\n  \"No.\"\n\n  \"Oh, you mean before we got interrupted.\"\n\n  I affirmed. \"That one.\"\n\n  \"Well, it's just family related. Nothing much.\" He laughed, as we began walking again.\n\n  \"Hmm-\"\n\n  \"Yeah. I got none. It's just me and my gran.\" His shocking response came, and my legs stood stiffly.\n\n  \"T-they're dead?\" I swallowed hard. \"Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.\"\n\n  \"Oh, it's fine. I think this is where we part ways, Trish.\"\n\n  \"Part ways?\" I asked, a bit surprised.\n\n  \"Ha! Not that kind.\"\n\n  Thank goodness, I exclaimed. \"I'll see you soon, Philip....\"\n\n\"Mac-Kenny. But call me, Phil.\".\n\n\"Oh, wow. Mine's Parker.\"\n\n  \"It's such a pleasure meeting you, Tricia Parker. Hope to see you again.\"\n\n  I smiled. \"Sure hope so, too.\"\n\n   I watched as he slowly disappeared, and was about taking the next turn when a hand came on my bum, startling me. \n\n  \"Oh my goodness!\" I uttered aloud.\n\n  \"Missed me?\"\n\n  \"Ohh!\" I yelled as the mystery guy came in front of me, and with a naughty expression written on his face, cupped my cheeks. \"Oh, how I've missed you.\" He grinned, nibbling sweetly on my lower lip.\n\n  I made to resist, but my feelings betrayed me at the sudden capture of the erotic feeling that was starting to gather up inside of me.\n\n  I let out a soft moan, my body melting totally in his arms. \"Ahh, James....\"\n\n  \"That's right, baby.\" He smirked, moving his hands down my back onto my enlarge butt cheeks as he gripped it in a way my kitty-cat made a spurting sound.\n\n  \"J-James, you know we can't do this here.\"I purred, vibrating from his touch.\n\n  \"Oh, please! No one really cares about us doing this here. You have no idea how much I've missed you.\" He grinned between kisses.\n\n  \"I know baby, but-\" I made to pull away, but he pulled me back, my bosom grazing his broad chest, which I could see clearly. \n\n  He went further into brushing my hair aside as he made to nibble on my earlobe. \n\n  \"Oh, that t-tickles.\" I laughed, feeling the wetness in between my legs.\n\n  \"Oh, I know, baby. You're gonna come see me tomorrow, right?\"\n\n  I looked up at him, giving a slight chuckle, my arms still wrapped up around him. \"I'll be right where you need me, baby.\" \n\nDon't forget to give me those smashing comments,my dearies.

Tricia! Hurry up, baby. Today's a big day for all of us.\" My mum said shrilly.\n\n  Her voice echoed so loudly from the living room and I feared it was going to bring down our storey building. She's the paranoid one, unlike my dad who's out working all the time. I can't help but think he and work were created on the same day. He's barely around. Most times, he'll come, and then, go all again.\n\n...So annoying....\n\n  \"Oh, Tricia,\" My dad followed almost immediately.\" Come on downstairs, Honey. It's past seven already.\" He announced.\n\n  Argh!Why can't those two just stop?It's not like I'm getting married or anything. I sighed, rushing downstairs, my right arm clutching tightly onto my backpack.\n\n  \"Oh, there you are, sweet pea,\" My mum said, embracing me warmly.\n\n  \"Mu-mum. Mum,you're squeezing me\"I heaved a deep sigh,trying to wriggle free. \"Mum!\" \n\n  \"Oh, you.\" she chuckled, releasing me. \"Mm, you look gorgeous, my baby.\" She complimented sweetly, eyeing the red jacket I had on my tank top.\n\n...Yeah, yeah. I do get that a lot...\n\n  I was one average teen, a bit huge, and had really good, welcoming bosom and a smashing, hot booty to match, which shook rhythmically when I walked. Guess that's the reason why the boys in our neighborhood never failed to steal a glance whenever I walked passed them - One perks of being adorable.\n\n  \"Thanks ma.\" I giggled, snatching my box from Josie.\n\n  Josie was our house keeper, a pigtailed, Browne eyed girl who seemed a lot quiet than usual. But that still didn't make me like her. She was so gullible. And the fact she and I were the same age made me detest her more - Humph!\n\n  \"Hope everything's all packed up, my sweet?\" My mum's voice came again. \"Remember,you don't wanna leave anything behind.\"she continued, accompanying dad and I to the garage.\n\n  \"Mmm-hmm,\"I  replied with a nod.\n\n  \"Oh, I'm really going to miss you, baby.\" She sulked, embracing me.\n\n  ...Bluff!Such drama...\n\n  \"Ma-\" I stopped. \"Oh mummy. You know I'm not a baby anymore.\"I laughed.\n\n  \"Oh, you. Do take care of yourself, all right? I know you'll make your father and I so proud.\" She smiled, caressing my cheeks.\n\n  \"And oh,\" Dad cut in. \"Always remember those advice we've been giving you. They'll sure be of help.\"\n\n  \"Sure daddy.\" I affirmed, giving my lips a slight lick.\n\n  \"I can't believe my baby's all grown up,\"\n\n  \"Gee,\" I gave a mutter and turned to face her. \"It's just college, mother. I'll be fine.\" \n\n  \"I know, baby.\"\n\n  \"Yo guys! Wrap it up. We gotta beat traffic, you know.\" Dad interrupted, getting into the SUV.\"\n\n  \"Oh.\"we both laughed.\n\n  \"I love you, mum.\"I said, getting in  right next to dad.\n\n  \"Oh, baby, mama loves you most.\" She said, bidding us goodbye.\n\n  Campbell! Ain't it adobes?! I smiled within, shutting the car door.\n\n  \"You okay there?\"\n\n  \"Never been better.\" I replied with doubts. \"Dad, do you think the girls over here will be better than ours at Henson?\" I asked curiously.\n\n  \"I don't know baby. Just try fit in, okay?\" He said. \"I know my little Sunshine's gonna make us proud.\"\n\n  \"You really think so, dad? I mean, what if I mess up?\"I continued, clasping my box.\n\n  \"Oh, I know so, baby. I'm sure you will.\" He spoke with full assurance.\n\n  \"Oh, thanks,daddy.\" \n\n  \"Uh, honey, what about these stuffs you packed in here? Need help moving them ? They're so heavy.\" He laughed, taking the rest of my luggage out of the trunk.\n\n  I faked a frown. \"Why do you worry so much, dad?\"\n\n  \"Why shouldn't I? My daughter's entering a new chapter, which I know would be-\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, dad. I know.\"\n\n\"Ha- Goody. Whew! Guess that's the lot. Still need me?\"\n\n\"Dad!\" I yelled, my brows arched at him.\n\n\"Come on, baby, you don't have to be like that.\" He laughed, poking my sides.\n\nI made to laugh, but took it all in, my eyeballs enlarged, sending him a signal he understood.\n\n\"Alright. I'm sorry.\" He gave a funny chuckle, getting into his car. \"I love you.\"\n\n\"Love you, too, dad.\"\n\n  Marionette hostel was one gigantic one, and had really long stairs. And if one wasn't careful, he or she could end up lost in the whole no-boys zone.\n\n...Can't believe it actually is...\n\n  \"Room 344.\" I muttered, turning the doorknob.\n\n  The milky painted room came in sight and I couldn't help but marvel at how convenient it looked. I can't say why I've got a nice feeling about this place - But loved it!\n\n  I tossed my bag carelessly on the bed that laid in the middle, giving a slight shrug as I took out my MP-3 player and my phone, a gasp eluding my lips as I remembered James.\n\n  \"Damn! He's really gonna be mad.\"\n\n  I gave a sharp slide on my phone, dialing his number swiftly. \"Shit! He's not answering.\" I groaned.\n\n  \"I'm sorry, who are you?\" A female voice came.\n\nOh, good Lord!\n\n  \"Ah. You must be the new girl Singer talked about. I'm Joan.\" She said with a British accent.\n\n  \"Tricia. Tricia Parker.\" I said.\n\n  \"Parker, huh? Any relation to the Brooklyn's.\"\n\n   \"Uh....no?\"\n\n  \"Heh! Forgive me, dear. Welcome to Campbell. Be sure to have such an ecstatic stay here. I'm a final year student, by the way. Theater Arts.\" She said at one stretch.\n\n...Doubt her words ever have commas in them...\n\n  I smiled. \"Lovely. I'm a newb, which I'm sure you already know.\" I said, my right hand suspended in the air.\n\n  \"Oh, right.\" She giggled. \"Newbies are always my favorite.\" She smiled, throwing a wink at me. \"Oops!

But it happened.\n\u201cHold on\u201d she said and suddenly ran out of the room.\nI went back to the bedroom and sat on the bed. What is she up to?\nHow can she even say such a thing?

It isn\u2019t gonna do a thing to you. You need to be on the safer side\u201d she said and forcefully fixed it into my hand.\n\u201cHere\u2019s how to make use of it. Go into the toilet, wee in a bottle or something; then insert the tube into the urine and watch out for the red lines. If it shows just one line, then it\u2019s negative. But if the line comes up two, then it\u2019s positive. Come on; try it\u201d she explained with so much enthusiasm.\nI looked at her and shook my head.\n\u201cSally, I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCome on Roxanne; this is for your own good. Do it\u201d she cut me off and gave me a prodding look.\nIt sounded insane.\nI gave her a hard stare and finally walked into the toilet room.\nWhy would she want me to carry out a p test? I can\u2019t be pregnant. It\u2019s just isn\u2019t possible.\nI can\u2019t be pregnant for\u2026Damon???\nOf course, not!\nMaybe I just needed to do the test after all.\nI wee into a small container and inserted the test tube like she said.\nThe first line came up immediately and at that moment, I suddenly became scared.\nMy hands wavered as I held the test tube. I could only see one line.\nAccording to her, that means it was negative, right?\nI started breathing heavily and nervously.\nYes! It was negative.\nOf course.\nGosh!\nI brought out the tube from the bottle and threw the urine away.\nOh, goodness! How could Sally try to make me this scared?\nI should probably show the result to her.\nI looked back at the test tube in my hand and saw something that almost made me scream.\nThe lines\u2026\nThe second line.\nIt did came up.\nThere were two lines!\nWhat?\nTo be continued\u2026\nOMG I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING NOW.\nRoxanne is pregnant\nWhat's gonna happen?\nWill he tell her to abort it\nOya let's being a name for the baby",

I rather call. That'd be better.\n\n  Another voice came, Oh, no you don't, Parker! Remember your reputation. It said.\n\n  I curved my lips, burying my face in my palms as I yelled silently into it. I can do this...I can do this.\n\n  I took a deep breath, making for his profile as his number stood surprisingly on his wall like it's being waiting for me to embrace it.\n\n  \"Yes!\"\n\n  I swiftly put it on the dial as it rang, \"It's Derek speaking. Please leave your message.\" His voicemail came.\n\n  \"Dang it, you!\" I groaned, hanging up.\n\n  I tossed my phone on the bed, getting up on my feet as I headed for the bathroom, taking up my shampoo by the corner.\n\n  I got in, shutting the door as I turned the shower on, the warm water spraying all over my face onto my bare skin. I shampooed my hair for some minutes, sponging my body for about thirty minutes, finally getting off whatever dirt that laid hidden, as I washed the lather off my body, the sweet fragrance of my soap enclosing my nostrils as it covered my feet.\n\n  I stepped out, turning the handle as I walked back to my room, tossing my towel on the bed as I stared across where my mirror hung, admiring my pretty curves and glowing skin...one habit I formed. \n\n  It was funny, really, but it was something worth doing and I certainly didn't mind staring at that figure in the mirror all day long.\n\n  I stopped the admiration for a moment, moving towards the bed as a name popped up on my screen. \"Oh yay. He's calling,\" I said happily.\n\n  I gave a slight cough and tried to relax my voice as I answered. \"Hel...loo,\"\n\n  \"Hi, Tricia,\" His sweet voice rang from the other line as a blush coated my cheeks.\n\n  \"Oh Phil. How nice of you to call,\" \n\n  He chuckled, \"You sound like you've been expecting me,\"\n\n   \"Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes,\" I smiled, sitting down as I got my legs crossed.\n\n  \"I see.\"\n\n  Guess he was smiling now.\n\n  \"So...why'd you call?\" I asked, making circles on my laps.\n\n  Damn! His voice is so hot, I imagined as we talked.\n\n  I was so lost in it that I wished he wouldn't stop talking.\n\n  \"Guess I'll see you tomorrow then.\" \n\n  \"Mm-hmm,\" I answered, nodding like he could see me. \"Take care. Byeeee.\" I puckered my lips, ending the call.\n\n  Wheeee! I fell back on the bed, silly thoughts crowding my mind.\n\n  I stayed that way for a moment, the sound of my phone jerking me up as I picked it up. Derek! I groaned, almost ignoring him as I answered.\n\n  \"Hello? Who is this, please?\" He questioned.\n\n  \"Derek I just wanna say I'm sorry for what I said to you some days ago,\" I saw myself saying.\n\n  OMG!\n\n  \"Tricia?\"\n\n  I held my breath for a second, releasing it again. \"Yes,\"\n\n  \"Tricia. Oh, man. I'm so happy hearing from you,\"\n\n  \"You are?\" I asked, startled.\n\n  \"I'm dead serious. Whew! I've been looking everywhere for you.\"\n\n  \"You've been looking for me?\" I repeated, my brows arched at an angle.\n\n  \"Do you have to repeat everything I say?\" He teased.\n\n  \"I'm just...you know, wasn't expecting you to be all...\"\n\n  \"Cheery? Hmm?\"\n\n  \"Totally happy-ish?\"\n\n  I shrugged. \"Ye-yeah,\" \n  \n  \"Oh, it's nothing,\" \n\n  \"Cool. Why'd you call?\"\n\n  \"I called? Or you called?\"\n\n  \"Totally wasn't me,\" I denied.\n\n  \"But..\"\n\n  \"Hush, hush. Got class now. I'm gonna see you later. Bye-bye. Love you.\" I said in a hurry, hanging up.\n\n  I made to dress as the door swung open. I didn't lock that, I realized.\n\n  \"You're back,\" I eyed Karen.\n\n  \"Yea, honey. Gosh! Quite a day we had,\" She narrated. \"Professor Stuart didn't let us rest. Ugh!\"  She grumbled, tossing herself on the bed. \"Going somewhere?\"\n\n  \"Oh, not at all. Just came back not quite long.\"\n\n  \"Lucky you. I need that shower most.\" She got up lazily.\n\n  \"That'd be great.\" I said to her and went back to slipping my shorts on.\n\n  I noticed I didn't hear the bathroom door creak so I glanced over my shoulders, seeing two eyes focused directly on bum as I quickly averted my gaze, hoping she hadn't notice.\n\n  Is she gay? I asked myself, making towards the bed.\n\n  \"You're one gorgeous girl, you know?\" I heard her say.\n\n  I scoffed, getting in bed. \"Whatever games you're playing, you had better stop!\" \n\n  \"Oh, I'm not playing any here, Sweet. You're really pretty,\" She continued, cat walking towards me.\n\n  \"I got up angrily, \"Out of my way...now!\"\n\n\"Or what?\"\n\n  \"You're horny, Karen Adako, so I'm just going to leave,\" I pushed her aside. \"And oh, one more thing,\" I turned. \"I DON'T DO GIRLS! Read my lips!\" I hissed, slamming the door. \"Some whore...\"",

We suddenly vanished.\nI gasped in fear as we landed on a different place \u2013 a quiet strange place filled with trees and bushes.\nI looked beside me and found Damon lying on the floor, his hand on the arrow.\n\u201cDamon!\u201d I cried and knelt beside him.\nTears came dripping down my cheeks.\nHis eyes fluttered as he groaned in pains. Could it be possible the arrow was poisoned?\nOf course;\nelse, it wouldn\u2019t have such impact on him.\n\u201cDamon\u201d I whimpered.\n\u201cWhat should I do? Please tell me\u201d.\nHe didn\u2019t say anything and blood started flowing from his mouth.\nIt increased my fears.\nI looked around, wondering if I could get some help. But the place was quiet and bushy. Where did he bring us to?\nHe probably just wanted to get away from Shantel and didn\u2019t take notice.\nI looked at the arrow and thought of pulling it out. Maybe it\u2019d ease the pains.\nI held the arrow and placed my other hand on his tummy.\nI suddenly felt scared.\nI shut my eyes and pulled out the arrow and he groaned wildly.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry; I\u2019m sorry\u201d I said amidst tears as I threw the arrow on the floor.\n\u201cRoxanne\u2019 he finally called, faintly.\nPains could clearly be heard from his voice.\n\u201cI can\u2019t make it\u201d he said and my eyes dimmed.\nWhat?\nI scoffed and looked directly into his face.\n\u201cD\u2026Damon?\u201d I floundered helplessly.\nWhat was he saying?\nHe suddenly became still and relaxed. His eyes were now closed.\n\u201cDamon?\u201d I called with my eyes wide open.\nHe didn\u2019t move.\nI shook my head and juddered him, but he still didn\u2019t move.\nWhat\u2019s happening???\nNo; this isn\u2019t possible. It can\u2019t be.\n\u201cDamon!\u201d I screamed and hit him.\nWhy isn\u2019t he moving? I can\u2019t let this happen.\nWhat\u2019s this supposed to mean?\nHe can\u2019t just\u2026die?\nTears dripped down my eyes like rainfall and poured on him.\n\u201cDamon\u201d I cried and lifted his body to hug me.\n\u201cDamon, you can\u2019t do this to me please. You can\u2019t just leave me. I need you. My baby needs you. Damon please, I know you\u2019ve been a terrible person to me, but I can\u2019t do without you. I\u2019m sorry I kept it away from you; but I\u2019m pregnant, Damon; I\u2019m pregnant.\n\u201cHow do you expect me to survive this without you? Please, don\u2019t do this to me. Open your eyes, Damon; please\u201d. I cried bitterly.\nI buried my face in his chest and wept.\nI felt so much pains; so much fear.\nHe can\u2019t possibly do this to me. He can\u2019t just die.\nNo; goodness, please. Don\u2019t allow this to happen.\n\u201cHe\u2019s never coming back\u201d I heard a familiar voice say and I turned in shock to see Shantel standing behind me.\nWhat???\nI gasped in trepidation and moved away from Damon.\nWhat\u2019s she doing here?\nHow\u2026\nNo;\nHow did she find us?\nDid she follow us?\nShe smirked and started coming towards me with a dagger in her hand.\n\u201cSo, Nicklaus was right after all\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou do love him. But now that I\u2019ve succeeded in taking him away, I think it\u2019s time I took that little thing of his right in your tummy\u201d.\nI stood on my feet immediately, my legs wobbling.\nShe increased her pace and came towards me with a full force and I tried to run but tripped and fell on the floor.\nShe laughed as she stood close to my feet.\n\u201cPoor Roxanne\u201d she sniggered.\n\u201cYour life has always been a mess right from birth. Perhaps, I\u2019m doing you a favor by trying to bring an end to it.\u201d\nI winced in fear and started crawling backwards.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t\u201d I whimpered as she pointed the knife at me.\nI held my tummy tight and shut my eyes. I can\u2019t afford to loose this baby now.\nI can\u2019t just go.\nMy eyes were still shut when I heard her scream and I quickly flung them open to see what was going on.\nAt first, I was blinded by the tears on my eyes, but I wiped them off and the view became clear to me.\nA bright light was shining on her and looked properly and saw Damon standing behind her with his hand stretched towards her.\nThe light was coming from him.\nI opened my mouth in shock and bewilderment.\nWhat was going on?\nWasn\u2019t he\u2026lying lifeless a while ago?\nShantel screamed in pains and fell on the floor and the light stopped.\nI watched in awe as Damon walked towards her, slowly, and stood in front of her.\n\u201cFirst, you tried to kill me\u201d he started.\n\u201cAnd second, you tried to kill the mother of my unborn baby. What treason could be greater than that?\n\u201d you deserve the death penalty\u201d.\nHe paused and formed a light with his hands.\nShantel was already shaking and tried crawling backwards.\n\u201cTherfore, with the powers vested in me as the King of hell, I hereby sentence you to death and an eternity in the flames of fire\u201d\n\u201cLucifer please\u2026\u201d she cried, but it was already too late as Damon threw the light at her and she vanished immediately, like nothing had been there before.\nMy eyes glistened.\nMy lips were shaking.\nWhat just\u2026\nWhat just happened?\nI remained stuck to the floor, unable to.to move.\nI\u2019ve never been this stunned in my entire life.\nHe started coming towards me and I just watched helplessly.\nHe had a vacuous expression on.\nHe got to where I was and stretched out his hand to me, but I was too enfeebled to even take it.\nI just kept staring, foxed.\nThen, he dropped to a crouch In front of me and helped me up; his hands on my shoulders.\nHe stared into my eyes without saying a word and my anxiety multiplied.\n\u201cWere you hurt?\u201d He asked but I still kept mute.\nHe took his hands from my shoulders and cupped my cheeks and for the first time, he kissed me.\nTo be continued\u2026"
