You're her only grandchild!\" But I respected her will.\n\nGrandma often read me fairy tales on this sofa, and I listened, fascinated, with a cup of tea. I loved spending time with her, and she understood me like no one else...\n\nInfluenced by childhood memories, I sat down on the sofa but instantly felt that something was wrong \u2014 a hard, sharp object was poking me in the back!\n\nAt my own risk, I cut open the sofa and found a green metal box. Inside were many papers and a letter addressed to me! I carefully opened it, and my heart stopped.\n\nHere's what it said. \u2b07\ufe0f",

It was a peaceful time, but inevitably, Jessica would reflect on her life during those moments. Today was one of those days.\n\nShe remembered her first wedding well, as it was the only time she had ever been excited to have one. Karl was the love of her life, or so she thought. But when she reached the end of the aisle on her father\u2019s arm, she saw everyone\u2019s worried faces. Karl had disappeared, and no one knew why.\n\nJessica cried on the steps of the Masonic Temple for several more hours. It was one of the best wedding venues in the city, and she had always dreamed of getting married there. However, it was not to be...\n\nDespite this, \"I had a great life,\" Jessica thought to herself while sipping her tea. It was true, although she never tried dating again. But once in a while, she thought about Karl and still wondered why he had disappeared.\n\nSuddenly, the mailman snapped her out of her thoughts with a bright smile and a loud, \u201cHello, Mrs. Pennington! I have a letter for you!\u201d Jessica took it in her hands, but the last thing she expected to see was the name 'Karl Pittman' on the envelope.\ud83d\udc47",

But then, in the afternoon, there was a knock at the door. A delivery man stood there with this massive, wrapped box that was so big it barely fit through the doorway.\n\nI was stunned. As I started unwrapping it, a small note fell out, \"From the wonderful woman who gifted you a husband.\" My heart sank \u2013 it was from my MIL.\n\nHere's the thing. My MIL has never liked me. She always thought I wasn't good enough for her son, constantly reminding me of my modest background. When our baby was born, she didn't even visit and said she didn't approve of me as the mother of her grandchild.\n\nSo, when I saw the gift was from her, I was in shock. Was she finally trying to make peace?\n\nI ripped off the wrapping paper, revealing a plain box underneath. But when I opened it, my heart dropped. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. My hands trembled, and Mark, standing beside me, went pale. He grabbed his phone and called his mom immediately. \"What have you done, Mom?! You intentionally \u2b07\ufe0f",

I'm a single mom, and for the last two months, we've been struggling financially. I can\u2019t express how bad I feel that I can't give my daughter the normal things she needs.\n\nLast night, I packed the little present I could afford and asked her if she had any big plans for her birthday. To my surprise, she said yes.\n\nShe then showed me a Google doc she had been working on, listing all the different companies in our area that offer something for FREE if you can prove it\u2019s your birthday.

It was a bit sudden, but I was always happy to spend time with my little grandson, so I didn't mind. She dropped him off with a huge bag of stuff and rushed to catch her plane.\n\nI didn't suspect anything unusual until I opened the bag. Inside, there were fall, winter, and spring clothes, as well as what looked like all of the baby's toys and medicine. It didn't look like a bag packed for two weeks.
