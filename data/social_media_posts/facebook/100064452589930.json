The fireman who discovered me, a kind-hearted man named Jack, and his wife, Susan, decided to adopt me and raise me as their own. They gave me a wonderful childhood, filled with love and warmth, but there was always a mystery surrounding my origins.\n\nJack told me that on the night he found me, he had caught a glimpse of the man who had left me, sitting in a car with a blonde woman, and what struck Jack most was that the man had a huge scar on his hand and walked with a noticeable limp.\n\nI never thought much about it, but then, one day, while watching a behind-the-scenes interview of a famous actor couple, I noticed something that made my heart skip a beat.\n\nAs the camera zoomed in on him, I saw it \u2014 the unmistakable scar on his hand.
