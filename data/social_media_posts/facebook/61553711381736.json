She ran straight to the officer at the front of the line and hugged him and said \"THE POLICE!!!\" he said \"hi sweetie!\" and she said \"thank you for protecting us!!\". Without a thought he picked her up and bought her a doughnut. The whole store was smiling and let me go to the front of the line to take this picture. He told her if she ever wanted a police car to go down to the station and ask for Danny and she'll get one. Sometimes I get down on myself, but today I felt like Ryder and I were raising our girls right. We teach these girls respect at a young age and times like these are proud moments. So many horrible things go around about the brave men and women who protect us and risk their lives for us. A few bad cops out of MANY do not make them all bad. There are thoughtful and kind law enforcement officers out there and I know a bunch, but this random act of kindnness filled my heart. I have no idea who this man is but thank you for making my day and especially my daughter's \u2764\nCredit: New Jersey State Police ( respect \ud83e\udee1)",

    "3": "Marilyn Monroe's marriage to playwright Arthur Miller was the subject of much scrutiny and criticism. The union between the sex symbol and the intellectual was seen as a mismatch by the media, who eagerly reduced Monroe to nothing more than an \"hourglass\" figure. Critics like Walter Winchell were quick to pounce on the relationship, calling Monroe the \"darling of the left-wing intelligentsia\" and insinuating that her connection to Miller was nothing more than a ploy for attention.\nBut to see Monroe solely as a symbol of beauty and Miller solely as a symbol of intellect was a gross oversimplification of their respective talents and personalities. Despite the judgment of others, Monroe and Miller were deeply in love, and their relationship was a meaningful and important part of both of their lives. The negative comments that surrounded their union only served to highlight the narrow-mindedness and superficiality of the media and society as a whole. S",

    "5": "In 1910, Mare Samuella Cromer, a rural schoolteacher in South Carolina, organized a girl's tomato club so females aged 9 to 20 could \u201cnot learn simply how to grow better and more perfect tomatoes, but how to grow better and more perfect women.\u201d Soon, there were tomato clubs in a number of states. The idea was simple: Teach rural girls how to plant and grow tomatoes, then harvest and can them, and sell them for a profit. The only work the girls didn't do themselves was the plowing of their individual 1/10th acre plots.\nIn one notable example, a girl harvested 2,000 lbs. of tomatoes. After sales, she earned a profit of $78 (about $2,470 today). This was *real* money for girls who came from hardscrabble backgrounds.\nIn 1915, one tomato club girl was quoted as saying the work was \u201clong and sometimes tiresome...It has been a way by which I could not only have my own spending money and pay my expenses at the Farm Camp, but I also have a bank account of sixty dollars.\" (About $1,881 today.)",

But as we teeter on the precipice, this moment in time between the baby I once held so tightly to my chest and the boy you are becoming, I\u2019m unsure how to let go.\n\nSure, you still need me, but not in the way you once did. Your eyes don\u2019t search around the room for me quite as often. Your arms don\u2019t reach out for me every moment of the day. Your hands don\u2019t grip mine as tightly.\n\nI can feel you slipping.\n\nAnd as much as my heart is filled with pride watching you grow, it also breaks a little for time lost when I wasn\u2019t even looking.\n\nThey warned me it went fast, but I guess I didn\u2019t quite understand. It\u2019s hard to see through it when you are in it.\n\nSo as you enter this big new world, I pray it greets you with kindness. Yet, I\u2019m not na\u00efve, I know it won\u2019t be without struggles.\n\nThere will be moments where your little heart will break. Moments where you question everything and nothing all at once, but I hope you never question my love.\n\nWhen you need reassurance or a hand to hold, I will lift your head up and remind you who you are.\n\nWhen you need a shoulder and a listening ear, I will be your safe place.\n\nWhen everything seems to be falling apart, I will be there to help you piece it back together.\n\nWhen you need a cheerleader, I will be your biggest fan.\n\nYou have me, forever.\n\nEven when you stand taller than I do and the word \u2018mom\u2019 bellows from deep within your chest...\n\nEven when your face full of facial hair...\n\nEven when you are a full-grown man standing where my once baby stood...\n\nI will see those dimpled hands and baby blue eyes looking up at me. Etched in the corners of my mind for eternity.\n\nBecause a mother\u2019s love never fades. It\u2019s constant. It\u2019s familiar and it\u2019s home.\n\nSo, while you may not need me the way you once did, I will be right behind you every step of the way.\n\nLetting go, little by little.\u201d S",
    "7": "He was the last act scheduled on November 3, 1957, and after Ed introduced him, Sam strolled out looking very cool. The music started, he sang \u201cDarling, you-ou-ou send me. I know\u2026\u201d, and the show was over. It was live TV, and the show had run long. The Sullivan Show received so many complaints that they immediately re-booked him.\n\nSo on December 1, 1957, Sam returned. Ed Sullivan introduced him by saying \u201cSam, here\u2019s the time.\u201d Dressed neatly in suit and tie, Cooke delivered a stripped-down version of \u201cYou Send Me.\u201d His performance used little more than backup vocals to compliment his singing, and centered on Cooke himself. As he crooned directly into the camera, his effortless charisma and charming smile made him a hit with audiences. Right after the show aired, \u201cYou Send Me\u201d reached number one on the Billboard Top 100, displaying just how successful his performance was.\n\nLater in the show, Ed brought Sam onstage and apologized to him and the audience saying, \u201cI did wrong one night here on our stage. And I never received so much mail in my life!\u201d Sam, now dressed in a tuxedo, sang his rendition of \u201c(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons,\u201d an R&B classic sung most famously by Sullivan show regular Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole in 1946. Ed Sullivan had always been a supporter of the civil rights movement, bringing on African-American artists like Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole before anyone else in the industry was. But while Cole had always been a very \u201csafe\u201d act, Cooke was pushing the envelope in regards to race and music. Cooke combined the smooth crooning style of past greats like Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra with a soulful tone that many in Sullivan\u2019s audience hadn\u2019t previously heard.\n\nIn his tragically short life, Cooke made only a few television appearances, and The Ed Sullivan Show performance is one of the only ones that still exist. It proved once again that Sullivan was a reliable ally of the civil rights movement, and jumpstarted Cooke\u2019s career as a pioneer of the \u201cSoul\u201d genre. Cooke\u2019s musical style had a massive influence on the creation of Motown and on artists like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder. Sam Cooke also went on to become an important leader in the civil rights movement because of politically-conscious songs like \u201cA Change is Gonna Come,\u201d released after his controversial death at the age of 33. But Cooke had the platform to speak out about the issues of his day only because of his early commercial success and fame. And for that, he has The Ed Sullivan Show to thank.\n\nIn his book \u201cDream Boogie: The Triumph of Sam Cooke\u201d, Peter Guralnick writes that Sam\u2019s music \u201cstill sounds as fresh, as elegant, as full of mirth, sadness and surprise as when it first emerged, translating somehow across the ages in ways that have little to do with calculation or fashion and everything to do with spontaneity of feeling, with a kind of purity of soul.\u201d S",
    "8": "Born on February 26, 1916, in Brooklyn, New York, John Herbert Gleason, known as \"The Great One\" or \"Jackie,\" faced a challenging adolescence marked by abandonment, tragedy, involvement with street gangs, and low-wage jobs. Despite the hardships, Gleason's breakthrough in the entertainment industry surprised many skeptics who doubted the sustainability of his fast-paced, humorous lifestyle. However, armed with entertainment savvy, determination, and charm, he achieved tremendous success as an actor, comedian, writer, and composer.\nWhile gaining widespread recognition for his role in the TV show \"The Honeymooners,\" Gleason also left a lasting impact with notable characters like Minnesota Fats in the film \"The Hustler\" and Buford T. Justice in the \"Smokey and the Bandit.\u201d Beyond his acting achievements, Gleason pursued a significant secondary career in music during the 1950s and 1960s, producing a series of bestselling \"mood music\" albums.\nA noteworthy aspect of Gleason's career on \"The Honeymooners\" was his aversion to rehearsal. While the rest of the cast ran through scenes without him, his catchphrases were sparingly used in the original 39 episodes, adding to the intrigue of his improvisational skills. For instance, \"Baby, you're the greatest!\" was uttered only nine times, \"Right in the kisser\" once, and his iconic \"Bang! Zoom!\" line was entirely improvised, never appearing in any scripts.",

    "17": "\"I snapped this picture the other night at the end of a long day. I was tired. I was irritated. I had sent my husband a text telling him that I knew it wouldn't make a difference, but I wanted him to know that I was feeling fed up with how much he works and with all that I have to do everyday by myself. The full time job, cooking dinner, bathing kids, weekend trips without him, keeping up a home, you name it I was resenting it. I have to have these little moments once (ok several times) throughout planting and harvest season. Then this happened. He came in, fixed his plate and sat down to eat all alone. He was tired. He was hot. He was exhausted. Rather than complain, he said he was sorry I was tired and felt that way. Charlotte joined him and talked his head off and even ate most of his dinner. He didn't complain. He shared, and it hit me. Do I wish that we saw him more than an hour or so a day? Yes. But, the love he has for his craft is something to envy. Farmers work in a thankless profession. It's always non GMO this and organic that, and let's not even talk about the stress from Mother Nature. This is a man who is working to uphold 4 generations of blood sweat and tears and showing his children the value of hard work and discipline. So while I felt frustrated, I really should have felt thankful. I got to sit down to dinner and hear all the stories from the day with the kids. I got to give them a bath and hear their squeals and giggles. I got to snuggle and love on them for 3 hours more than he did. He is the one sacrificing, not me. We will keep on keeping on until the next rainy day when we get a few extra hours with our hard worker. In the meantime, the next time you slip into that comfy cotton shirt or eat delicious farm fresh food, thank a farmer. Where would we be without them?\" S",

    "19": "Doris Day had a fear of flying that stemmed from tours with Bob Hope in the 1940s that resulted in some close calls in impenetrable winter weather. She almost turned down her role in Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" (1956) because it was to be filmed in London and Marrakesh. Her husband and manager, Martin Melcher, talked her into accepting it.\nThroughout the filming, Day became increasingly concerned that Hitchcock paid more attention to camera set-ups, lighting, and technical matters than he did to her performance. Convinced that he was displeased with her work, she finally confronted him. His reply was, \"My dear Miss Day, if you weren't giving me what I wanted, then I would have to direct you!\"\nAt first, Day refused to record \"Que Sera, Sera\" as a popular song release, dismissing it as \"a forgettable children's song\". It not only went on to win an Academy Award, but also became the biggest hit of her recording career and her signature song. She sang the same song in two more movies, \"Please Don't Eat the Daisies\" (1960) and \"The Glass Bottom Boat\" (1966), and it was used as the theme song for all one hundred twenty-four episodes of her television series, \"The Doris Day Show.\"\nIt was during the making of this movie, when she saw how camels, goats and other \"animal extras\" in a marketplace scene were being treated, that Day began her lifelong commitment to preventing animal abuse. She was so appalled at the conditions the animals were in, that she refused to work unless they were properly fed and cared for. The production company actually had to set up \"feeding stations\" for the various goats, sheep, camels, etc. and feed them every day before Day would agree to go back to work. S"
