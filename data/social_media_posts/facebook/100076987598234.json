Despite his recent good health\u2014normal eating, activity, and weight\u2014he was found to have severe gastric pyloric obstruction, with multiple organ hemorrhages and acute inflammation. These issues led to multi-system failure and ultimately his death. Though his loss is deeply felt, we can only express our heartfelt sorrow and hope that \"Tong Tong\" rests peacefully, free from pain. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude2d\u2764\ufe0f #rip",

    "3": "\ud83d\udc3cPanda Q&A\ud83d\udc3c\nQ: Why do caretakers need to smash #bamboo?\nA: In the wild, giant #pandas choose bamboo with a smaller diameter for easier grasping. However, in #captivity, the bamboo provided is often thicker than what wild pandas eat. Therefore, caretakers smash the bamboo into strips or segments to make it easier for pandas to grasp and eat. This practice not only makes it easier for pandas to handle and consume the bamboo but also significantly reduces the wear on their teeth during feeding, thus protecting their oral health.\nIn addition to facilitating feeding and reducing dental wear, smashing bamboo also benefits the psychological health of giant pandas. Pandas have acute hearing and are sensitive to changes and unusual sounds in their environment, which can cause stress. The crisp sound of bamboo being smashed daily becomes a familiar background noise in their captive environment, helping them build a kind of \"immunity\" to these sounds and reducing their tendency to become frightened or stressed by sudden noises. This has a positive impact on their mental well-being. #trivia #triviachallenge #animals",

With this data, scientists can delve into understanding the panda population\u2019s structure and habits, making precise decisions about whether a panda to be reintroduced into the wild is male or female and where it should be released. Fresh panda droppings are green, often shaped like sweet potatoes, and are covered with a slimy surface within a week. When broken open, they have a minty, slightly bitter smell, which is the result of fermented bamboo leaves. #trivia #triviachallenge #animals",

Except during the breeding season, they live alone, maintaining their own territories. They can be solitary due to their strong bite force, robust physique, sharp claws, and agility in climbing trees, which means they have few natural enemies. Additionally, giant pandas mainly eat bamboo, so they don't need to cooperate like carnivores such as wolves. Pandas only come together during the breeding season, and after mating, they separate. Panda cubs are raised solely by their mothers without the father's involvement. #wildanimals #triviachallenge",

    "19": "\ud83d\udc3cPanda Q&A\ud83d\udc3c\nQ: How much #bamboo do caretakers need to prepare for giant #pandas each day?\nA: In #captivity, caretakers prepare bamboo based on each panda's size and individual consumption needs. Giant pandas eat approximately 6% to 15% of their body weight in bamboo daily. Specifically, an adult giant panda needs to consume 10 to 15 kilograms of fresh bamboo each day to meet its nutritional and energy needs. However, since more than half of the bamboo is often wasted, caretakers need to prepare an ample supply, with each panda requiring 20 to 30 kilograms of bamboo daily. #trivia #triviachallenge #animals"
