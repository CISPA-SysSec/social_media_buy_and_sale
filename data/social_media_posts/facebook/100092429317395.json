    "1": "A mechanic was removing a cylinder head from the engine of a Range Rover when he spotted a well-known heart surgeon in the shop who was waiting for the service manager to take a look at her Mercedes.\n\nAs she was waiting the mechanic shouted across the garage: \"Hey doc, can I ask you a question?\"\n\nThe surgeon, a bit surprised, walked over to where the mechanic was working on the Range Rover. The mechanic straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag, and asked,\n\n\"So Doc, look at this engine. I open its heart, take the valves out, repair any damage, and then put them back in, and when I finish, it works just like new. So how come I get such a small salary and you get the really big money when you and I are doing basically the same work?\"\n\nThe surgeon smiled, leaned over, and whispered to the mechanic, \"Try doing it with the engine running.\"\n\n#trucklovers #trucks #mechanic #cars #doctor #machine #engineering",
