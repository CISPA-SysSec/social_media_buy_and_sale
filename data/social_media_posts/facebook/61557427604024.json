So, I grew up thinking I was a burden and was glad to finally leave home for college. Shortly after that, my mom called with the great news that she had found the perfect man and was marrying him. I was overjoyed for her and was happy to come home to meet my stepfather.\n\nI never imagined that a peaceful family reunion would turn into a nightmare when my mom accused me of seducing my stepdad and kicked me out of the house, refusing to pay for college.\n\nI hadn't seen her for years until she showed up unexpectedly at my work.\ud83d\udc47 See less See less",

Everyone was super nice, EXCEPT FOR the maid. She shot me this look like I was an unwelcome guest there.\nAnyway, I was making breakfast the following morning when I realized my phone was missing. I tore through the house, no luck. But after a tense search, I spotted it casually abandoned on a seat the maid had just left.\nI unlocked it and saw this chilling message blinking back at me, \"Check your husband's drawer.

Everything was just perfect except for one tiny, festering cloud: his family.\n\nFrom the moment I met them, they've been frosty. Side-eyed glances, the whole passive-aggressive nine yards, but they gave me NO reason in person.\n\nRecently, I went shopping for our wedding when I saw Alex's parents dining at a restaurant with a young woman and waved at them.\n\nBut when they saw me, they both made wry faces and pretended not to recognize me at all. It was the LAST straw, so I made up a plan to teach them a lesson.\n\nA week later, when they finally saw me at our rehearsal dinner with my parents, they awkwardly approached us to get introduced. With a smile, I said, \"I'm sorry, do I know you?\"\n\nYou should\u2019ve seen their faces!! But the MOST interesting part only started in the link below. \u2b07\ufe0f See less See less",

She never liked me, but over time she came to terms with the fact that I married her son, and that was enough for me. On the day of her death, I was out of town. We knew she had been sick for a while, but it happened so unexpectedly that I couldn\u2019t even catch a flight back in time.\n\nWhen I finally got home, there was a cardboard box waiting on my porch with a note attached, \u201cFor Maddie. Open When Alone. Love, Betty.\"\n\nMy MIL had never told me she loved me. I was so shocked by the note alone. I grabbed the box and rushed to open it on the kitchen table while my husband was still at work. What I found inside turned my marriage upside down. What I did with her gift is in the comments below.
