It was the first of Mercedes' \"homologation specials\" and was created to resemble a road car while being almost a purebred racing machine. The CLK GTR was successful in its debut season, winning seven out of eleven races and earning both the drivers' and teams' championships\nThe CLK GTR was designed by AMG to meet the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile's GT1 regulations for the FIA GT Championship. The car shares nothing mechanically with the road-going Mercedes-Benz CLK, except for the headlights, rear taillights, and grille.\nThe CLK GTR was built by HWA RACELAB, a well-known manufacturer of AMG components, and only 20 coupes and six roadsters were produced from 1998\u20131999 and 2006. The first CLK GTR prototype was a McLaren F1 GTR longtail with modifications, but it was eventually crashed in a test and is now an F1 GTR again. Mercedes was able to complete the first two proper prototypes in just 128 days.\nThe CLK GTR's successor is the Mercedes CLR, which was designed specifically for the LMGTP (LeMans GT Prototype) class. LMGTP cars are loosely based on road cars, but are too radical for road use. The CLR has a sleek appearance, being much lower and more sharply angled at the front.",
