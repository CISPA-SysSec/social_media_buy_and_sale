The unrest spread through Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Blackpool, and Belfast, where missiles were thrown, shops were looted, and police officers were atta3ked.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has assured police forces of the government\u2019s \u201cfull support\u201d to take decisive action against \u201cextremists\u201d aiming to \u201csow h**e\u201d.\nTensions have been high following the k+lling of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party by alleged knifeman Axel Muganwa Rudakubana in Southport, Merseyside, on Monday, July 29.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, angry far-right thugs stormed into a hotel housing Asylum seekers and set a fire, TheMirror Uk reports. Hundreds of vi3lent anti-immigration protesters clad in balaclavas and draped in St George\u2019s flags clashed with officers trying to protect the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. At least one cop has been inj\u00a5red in the chaos outside the hotel on the northern outskirts of the post-industrial town, Daily Mail reports.\n\nIt marks yet another day of vi3lent riots of Britain\u2019s streets, after chaos ensued this week leaving cops with broken bones, cars set on fire and innocent pedestrians targeted on the streets. While photos from the scene have shown some occupants looking out of the hotel window onto rioters, it is still unclear if the migrants and asylum seekers housed in the property have been able to evacuate.\n\nOne person\u2019s face was seen completely covered with a Union Jack mask while they waved a large England flag outside the hotel while others swung back cans of bears while chanting offensiv3 slogans.
