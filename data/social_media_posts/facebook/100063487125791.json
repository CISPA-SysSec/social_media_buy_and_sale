    "1": "We had fun today doing a little tournament of our version of football in the knockerballs today at Founders Hall Middle School in McKeesport PA. The kids were hyped up and had signs made and everything. The atmosphere was electric and teachers got involved. So much fun. I had a Microphone doing play by play and they played hype music before each match. Really fun event and they want to do it again next year. I am pumped to do this one again. It felt like the knockerball version of the old And 1 basketball games if anyone ever watched them.",
