After the ceremony, we had the reception in a lovely hall nearby. As we were opening gifts later in the evening, I noticed an envelope with my name in the pile. Curious, I opened it to find $7,340 in cash and a handwritten note that simply said, \"Run away. Trust me.\"\nMy heart raced. Who would send something like this on my wedding day? I showed it to Dan, but he just laughed it off, saying it was probably a prank. I wasn't convinced. The handwriting seemed oddly familiar, but I couldn't place it.\nThat night, as Dan and I settled into our hotel room, I couldn't stop thinking about the envelope. I \u2b07\ufe0f",

He's the type who'd redo an entire job if he thought it wasn't perfect.\nSo, he lands this gig for a complete bathroom remodel. We're talking the works \u2013 new tiles, new fixtures, the whole shebang. The homeowners were all smiles at first. They picked out every single detail \u2013 the tiles, the grout color, and even the position of the sink and toilet. Dad was there every step of the way, making sure everything was perfect.\nFast forward to the last day of the job. Dad's just finishing up the grouting when the homeowners suddenly flip the script. They start complaining about the tiles, saying it's not what they wanted. Total nonsense, because they literally picked everything out themselves. But here's the kicker \u2013 they tell him they're only paying HALF of what they owe him. HALF! After two weeks of busting his hump to get their dream bathroom done.\nDad tries to reason with them, but they're not having it. They smugly tell him to finish up and GET LOST.\nMy Dad is usually a people-pleaser, but he knew he was being played. So, he agrees to finish the job. But he's got a plan to teach these entitled people a lesson. So, my dad took \u2b07\ufe0f",
