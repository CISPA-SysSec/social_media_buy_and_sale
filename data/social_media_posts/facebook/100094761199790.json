Steve saw something inside the jacket's pocket.\n\"Mike! Our mom...she had the same one,\" Steve grabbed his brother's shoulder and showed what was in his hand.\n\"Do you even remember our mom passed away?\" Mike asked. But then he turned pale, seeing what his twin brother held in his hand.\nThe full story is in the comments.",
