However, the last time he arrived, he seemed nervous and fidgety. Instead of talking to my little ones, as he usually does, and high-fiving them before leaving, he shoved the food into my hands and rushed back to his car.\nStunned and confused, I watched him drive away. As I brought the food into the kitchen, still wondering what his deal was, I happened to look at the back of the bag\u2014and froze. In shaky handwriting, there was a message that made me forget about lunch and everything else. I rushed to the backyard.

She slandered me, convincing everyone that I was saying terrible things about her, and I was not invited to the wedding. Everyone hated me.\nBut 2 weeks before the wedding, unexpectedly, Shelley\u2019s mother called me.\nShe: \"Hi. Get in the car and drive to me, it's urgent.\"\nMe: \"Hey Jen, what's up?\nAnd she dropped a bombshell on me.\"\nShe: \"We need to cancel the wedding because...\"\nFull story in comments! \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47",

    "8": "MAN OFFERED TO HELP ME WITH MY BABY ON A PLANE \u2014 I WAS SO GRATEFUL, UNTIL I SAW WHAT HE DID TO MY SON\nI was on a flight from New York to Los Angeles with my 14-month-old baby. As any parent knows, traveling with an infant can be incredibly stressful, and this flight was no exception. My baby was fussy and crying, and I could feel the judgmental stares from other passengers.\nAbout an hour into the flight, a kind-looking man sitting across the aisle offered to help. He smiled warmly and said:\n\"Would you like me to hold your baby for a while? I have a daughter around the same age, and I know how tough it can be.\"\nDesperate for a break, I reluctantly agreed. He seemed genuine, and I was exhausted. He took my baby and started rocking her gently. I turned around to get my laptop and some snacks from the backpack, and this was when the crying suddenly stopped. I turned back and was frightened to see \u2b07\ufe0f",
    "9": "MY ELDERLY NEIGHBOR VISITED AN OLD CABIN EVERY DAY AT THE SAME TIME \u2014 I NEARLY FAINTED WHEN I CHECKED INSIDE ONE DAY.\nJust moved into a new neighborhood, and my closest neighbor is this 65-year-old woman. She lives in an old house with a shabby shack about 20 feet away.\nShe's super secretive and totally brushes me off when I try to chat. But here's the weird part: every day at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., she heads to that shack with some bags, spends about 20 minutes there, and then heads back.\nOne time I tried to approach the shack, but she came running out, screaming, \"STAY AWAY! I'LL CALL THE COPS!\" Alright, I backed off.\nCuriosity got the best of me, so I decided to check it out at night. When I got to the shack, I found a big lock on the door. But then I spotted a small gap in the wooden door.\nI peered through it and almost passed out. With my flashlight, I saw that on the floor was lying a \u2b07\ufe0f",

So you can't afford two seats? Next time pass the hat, I'm sure all your fellow passengers will be very generous!\"\nThe woman turned her face to the window, and in the reflection, James could see the tears running down her cheeks.\nHe was sipping the last of his wine. A few minutes later, the captain's voice came over the speakers.\ud83d\udc47",

    "15": "MILLIONAIRE MOCKS POOR WOMAN WITH 3 KIDS ON BUSINESS CLASS FLIGHT UNTIL PILOT INTERRUPTS HIM\n\"Ugh! You can't be serious! Are you really making her sit here?!\" Louis Newman grumbled as he noticed a mother-of-three approaching his seat.\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" the stewardess replied gently. \"These seats have been assigned to Mrs. Debbie Brown and her children, and we can't do anything about it.\"\nThe rich man got even more annoyed. What irritated him even more was that he was forced to sit next to a woman who seemed not to belong to the business class, wearing the cheapest clothes on the flight.\nLouis Newman couldn't stop complaining all throughout the flight, until an announcement over the intercom interrupted him.\nRather than turning off the intercom after his announcement, the pilot, Captain Tyler Brown, continued. Suddenly, all passengers on the plane turned their heads to look at Debbie and her 3 kids.\ud83d\udc47",

It was odd because she never cared about the mail before, but I handed her the key anyway.\nThe next day she asked again, and then it became a daily thing. She also started acting secretive and asking weird questions. One night, when I was tucking her in, she asked, \"Mom, can people talk through letters even if they don't know each other well?\"\nThe next morning, I saw her slipping something into her backpack. When I asked, she just smiled and said it was for a school project.\nI couldn't take it anymore. She was SO protective of the mailbox, calling it \"a secret,\" which really freaked me out. I pretended to let it go and told her to head to school.\nAfter she left, I opened the mailbox and TEARS STARTED STREAMING DOWN MY FACE as I saw a pack of letters from \u2b07\ufe0f",
