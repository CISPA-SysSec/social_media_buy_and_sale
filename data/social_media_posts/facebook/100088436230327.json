They did that anyway without him. I think the fact that he\u2019s been out for so long, it will be interesting to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously Arsenal haven\u2019t made a lot of additions to their squad this year, so he feels like a new addition. I would just like to see him play & see how he fits in.\u201d [Sky]",
