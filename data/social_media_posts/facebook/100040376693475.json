    "1": "Gilmour was part of the reason for the transfer ban, now he\u2019s flourishing because of it\n\nIt was around this time last year that the news came down from FIFA mountain: Chelsea had been banned for the next two transfer windows (and fined, too, but that\u2019s pocket change). And while Chelsea eventually appealed successfully (to CAS) to get the ban cut in half, we effectively served out the full sentence anyway since we didn\u2019t sign anyone in January.\n\nInto that vacuum have stepped a veritable plethora of young players, most long-time members of the Chelsea Academy. One of the exceptions to that trend has been Billy Gilmour, who\u2019s as young as any of them, if not even more so, but he only joined the club in 2017, when he turned 16.\n\nNot three years later, he\u2019s turning all the heads, especially after his Man of the Match performance against league-leaders Liverpool in the FA Cup this week. It was only his 6th appearance for the first-team; it might as well have been his 60th.\n\nFantastic. Personality on the ball, intelligence in his desicion making, always making angles to offer himself and has that bit of aggression in him which is very important specially in the Premier League.\n\n\u2014 Cesc F\u00e0bregas Soler (@cesc4official) March 3, 2020\n\nGilmour has been roundly praised for Tuesday\u2019s efforts, but if you read the headline, you can guess where this piece is going. Gilmour, who counted as an \u201cinternational\u201d signing for FIFA\u2019s purposes since the English and Scottish Football Associations are separate entities, was one of the players involved in the transfer ban case. And it\u2019s actually very easy to figure out how he factored in, even though no names were ever used during the legal proceedings.\n\nChelsea were hit with 29 breaches of Article 19, with the specific players involved identified only by numbers 1-29. These counted for the bulk of the violations. But Chelsea were also hit with two counts of breaching Article 18bis, which is the bit about third-party influence.\n\nBasically, FIFA claimed that in the process of arranging future transfers, Chelsea exerted undue influence on another team by preventing them from operating autonomously and making decisions regarding one of their own players on their own. And while some, including Chelsea in the appeal, might argue that\u2019s an unavoidable side-effect or agreeing a future transfer (Chelsea reserved veto power over any loan moves for said players in the interim, for example), FIFA did not see it that way.\n\nMore pertinently to this story, FIFA identified these two cases not by numbers, but by the other teams involved: Ajax and, you guessed it, Rangers. The Ajax player in question is probably Juan Familia-Castillo (now back with Ajax, ironically); the Rangers kid is undoubtedly Billy G. Chelsea hadn\u2019t signed anyone from Rangers since the \u201890s (Nigel Spackman in 1992?) before young Gilmour made the southbound journey a few years ago.\n\nSo, Chelsea agreed to sign Gilmour, then ensured that Rangers wouldn\u2019t do something altogether silly with him. As FIFA note, somewhat to their credit, they realize that teams enter such common-sense agreements all the time, but apparently never in such a formalized manner \u2014 and we couldn\u2019t do a sign-and-loan-back like with Christian Pulisic and BVB, since Gilmour wasn\u2019t yet 17.\n\nObviously Gilmour wasn\u2019t the only reason Chelsea were banned (FIFA investigated Chelsea\u2019s dealings with over 92 players just for Article 19 violations alone), but he played his part. Now he\u2019s set to play an even bigger part in something that matters even more \u2014 and no, I don\u2019t mean another Burberry fashion shoot",

There is an agreement in place which is fairly relaxed. I haven't heard anything.\n\n\"It has been difficult for Charly but, equally, it's been difficult for Patrick Roberts - young Odsonne Edouard has come in from PSG.\n\n\"I'm relaxed with all of that. There are stories around these things, but I'm experienced with working with players.\n\n\"Across the board, I've taken lots of players from lots of clubs and given them opportunities.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's down to the players.\n\nBrendan Rodgers says it has been difficult for Musonda this season at Celtic\n\"Charly's probably not played as much as he would have liked to, but there are obviously reasons for that.\n\n\"I'll always bring players to develop them and, in the main, it's normally what happens when they are in my environment.\n\n\"At times, there are things off the pitch that people won't understand.\n\n\"It's difficult for players when they move to different cities and areas, that settlement.
