The commentary allows me to add more value to the clips while helping explain why the clip is either a fail, epic, or funny moment. This gives the watchers a deeper understanding of what is going on in the clips while helping people improve their gameplay. By editing the clips myself and giving them \"my own touch\" I am able to present a more fast-paced and enjoyable experience for the viewers.\n\n I have full permission to use and monetize every clip in the video. I provide the link to every submitter's channel in the description while showing their name on screen throughout the video."
