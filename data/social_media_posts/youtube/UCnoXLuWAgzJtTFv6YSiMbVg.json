I persuaded some of the greatest living traders/investors around the world to mentor me 1to1 their best trading strategies. \n\u2063\u2063\nToday\n- I became a multimillionaire and grew my trading/investing portfolio to \u00a35 million at the age of 30.\n- retired my parents, bought them a house, travel them around the world\n- i found my purpose after transforming my family/friends lives by teaching them\n- successfully train hundreds of beginners to make more income from trading/investing than their full-time job/business"
