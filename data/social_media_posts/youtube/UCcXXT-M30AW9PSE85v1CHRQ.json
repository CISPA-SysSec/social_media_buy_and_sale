I first use CapCut or KineMaster to isolate individual characters for further editing.\nI then add unique sound and visual effects to these characters,\ncreating an interesting visual style in Adobe Premiere Pro. I also use free images from Google as backgrounds for locations in videos to add realism and context.\n\n\u203c\ufe0fAll my videos contain materials\nprotected by the fair use principles of Section 107 of the Copyright Act.\nThese videos take about 4 hours to create so my viewers can feel the difference between the original video and the video I created. I also want to note that the audio and video sources in my videos are created in such a way,\nso that my viewers hear and see new UNIQUE content that they have not yet seen on other channels!!"
