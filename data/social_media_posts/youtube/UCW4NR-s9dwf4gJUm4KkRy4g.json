Pests are handled with crop rotations and companion planting. Farm workers also handle pests by hand. \n\nThese time tested traditions are why our farmer\u2019s say that our produce is \u201cBetter than Organic\u201d. A person only has to wander through the lush greenhouses replete with its own bees to know there is something very special happening there.\n\n Come, be a part of our Eden Valley Farm family!"
