My channel differs from similar ones in that I create videos with a special approach: first I use Adobe Animate to create animations, and then I add unique sound and video effects in Adobe Premier Pro. I also use free images from google against the background of my locations in the video.\ud83d\udd25\n\nAll my videos contain materials protected by the fair use rules of Section 107 of the Copyright Act. It takes about 10-15 hours to create these videos so that my viewers can feel the difference between the original video and the video I created.\n\nThe audio and video sources in this video are created in such a way that the viewer can hear and see new UNIQUE content.\na1aa0caf69c8e16a474e\nRYDJDT"
