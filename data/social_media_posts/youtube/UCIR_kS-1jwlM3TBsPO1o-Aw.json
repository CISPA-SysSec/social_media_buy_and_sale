On my YouTube channel, I play video games and make live streams.\n\nHow I create videos: I either use OBS software to stream live while making commentary on the game, or I play games and record footage. I use my microphone to record my own voice and remark on each video. When editing videos that I edit myself, I utilize Premier Pro. I use my Photoshop editing skills to produce the thumbnails. I am the sole owner and recorder of all the footage I utilized in my video. There are no repurposed videos on my channel\u2014all gameplay clips are original recordings and edits by me. I'm grateful.\n\nHit that subscribe button, buckle up, and let's level up together on this incredible gaming journey! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\""
