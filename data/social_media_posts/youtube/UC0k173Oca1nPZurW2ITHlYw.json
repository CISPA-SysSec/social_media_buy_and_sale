I will check out all suggestions.\n\n\u25ba Businesses - I am happy to cover your product for free if it's unique & interesting, if it's just another version of an everyday thing that already exists, I am not interested.\n\nNote: My Accent is Australian not English, like some have thought.\n\nThanks\nScott \n\nf49aef6f63654ccfdcb7"
