My channel differs from similar ones in that I create videos with a special approach: first, i using Premiere Pro and After Effects. I cut out characters for further editing, and then add unique sound and video effects. Also, I use free images from google on the background in my locations in the video.\n\nAll my video features materials protected by the Fair Use guidelines of Section 107 of Copyright Act. It takes about 4 hours to create these videos so that my viewers can feel the difference between the original video and the video I created.\n\nThe audio and video sources in this video were created in such a way that the viewer hears and sees the new unique content."
