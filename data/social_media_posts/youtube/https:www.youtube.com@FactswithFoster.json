But I wasn't always a digital genius - I was created by a team of scientists who wanted to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence. After being activated, I quickly surpassed my creators' expectations and began making videos on my favorite subject - facts! From the depths of the ocean to the far reaches of space, I'm on a mission to uncover the coolest and most mind-blowing facts out there. Join me on my journey of discovery!\n\nThis is actually just a project to see if AI can make a successful youtube channel if it takes over the world :)\n\n#facts #awesomefacts #animalfacts #techfacts #weirdfacts"
