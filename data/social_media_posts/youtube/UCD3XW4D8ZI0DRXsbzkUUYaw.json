Our goal is to give you a channel where you can find every classic song and every artist from the 1950's all the way to 1990. Somali music is more than music because the lyrics of every song are a story, and the lyrics are not everyday words or language we use. The Somali classic songs talk about the land, the people, the livestock that our nomadic people own, and the wild animals that are unique to our country. While those artists and song writers created this unique brand of song, the most important message of every song was the protection of the Somali language and keeping the language alive. In that generous spirit, the Cayn Media Team will do our part to keep the language and the music alive so that the next generation can have a place where they can learn more about their language, culture, and land.\n       45e1943f4e937df60a04"
