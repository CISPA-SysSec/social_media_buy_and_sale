After all, each of my videos is built in such a way as to develop mindfulness and observation.\n\nI make all my videos myself: I print, cut, shoot, edit, and so on. I would be happy to create more content, but unfortunately, each video takes about 5-6 hours \u23f0\n\nOver time, there will be more and more videos on the channel, and you definitely won\u2019t be able to get bored here \ud83e\udd73"
