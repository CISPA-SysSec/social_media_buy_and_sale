My channel differs from similar ones in that I create videos with a special approach: first I use Adobe Photoshop to draw or cut out characters for further animation, and then I add unique sound and video effects. I also use free images from google in the background in my locations in the video.\n\nYou can watch our channel if you 13+ yers old and if you want to have a great time! \n \nAll my video features materials protected by the Fair Use guidelines of Section 107 of Copyright Act. It takes about 4 hours to create these videos so that my viewers can feel the difference between the original video and the video I created.\n \nThe audio and video sources in this video were created in such a way that the viewer hears and sees the new UNIQUE content.\n\n\n74cfbfb300561ebb080b"
