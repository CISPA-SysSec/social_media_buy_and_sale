My channel differs from similar ones in that I create videos with a special approach: first, using the FL Studio sequencer, I create a unique melody from free sounds, then open Adobe Premiere Pro, cut out characters from various cartoons for further editing, and then add unique sound and video effects. Also, I use free images from Google in the background in my videos.\n\nAll my videos contain materials protected by the fair use rules of Section 107 of the Copyright Act. It takes about 2 hours to create these videos so that my viewers can feel the difference between the original video and the video created by me.\n\nThe audio and video sources in this video were created in such a way that the viewer could hear and see new UNIQUE content."
